## Proposed Solution (Refined)
We will stand up a **custom “Portfolio Gap” analytics environment** purpose-built around Jake’s stated goal: quickly identifying **where B. Braun is not participating in items the market is buying**, and doing so through his preferred lens of **Committed Members** (members with high IV Fluid share).

This environment will be configured to:
- **Apply a “Committed Member” filter by default** so Jake can isolate the accounts where B. Braun is already winning IV Fluids—and immediately see **what else those same members are purchasing outside of B. Braun** across the six agreed categories (**Infusion Devices, Sets/Accessories, Connectors, Fluids, TPN, Catheters**).
- Produce **ranked Portfolio Gap outputs** (by spend, units, growth, and supplier concentration) that spotlight the highest-impact “missing” SKUs and product families—specifically tied back to B. Braun’s **Triple Play / Plus 3** bundle strategy.
- Enable **bundle-adjacency views** that show, for Committed Members, what typically co-purchases with IV Fluids (and where B. Braun is absent), allowing Jake to move from “gap identification” to “bundle actionability.”
- Support Jake’s validation need by incorporating a **CAPS (503B) + pharmacy admixture representation check** using a controlled sample built from B. Braun-provided SKU lists—so Jake can confirm Premier’s ability to accurately reflect those markets before broader buildout.

This will align to the previously discussed **$150K initial engagement (data + services)** and focus the build on Jake’s specific workflow: **Committed Member → co-purchase patterns → portfolio gaps → bundle opportunities**.

## Call to Action (Jake-Driven)
To build the **validation sample Jake requested** (CAPS/503B + pharmacy admixture) and keep momentum from Friday’s demo, please send the **SKU list(s)** for CAPS/Pharmacy (manufacturer item numbers and any crosswalks you have). Once received, we will turn around an initial **Committed Member–filtered Portfolio Gap readout** for that sample so Jake can validate coverage and accuracy quickly.
