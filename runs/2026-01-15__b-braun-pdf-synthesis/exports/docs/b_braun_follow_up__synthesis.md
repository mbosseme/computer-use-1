## 1) Executive Summary (6–10 bullets)

- The discussion focused on expanding a **custom analytic service** for a client’s IV market analysis from an initial **IV fluids** focus to a **holistic view across IV therapy categories**.
- The client explicitly requested more emphasis on the **“triple play” (bag, tubing, catheter)**, noting that **fluids are least important** to them and “don’t make us any money.”
- The team aligned that the “triple play” analysis should effectively cover **five IV therapy categories** (infusion devices; infusion sets/accessories; needleless connectors; fluids & bag-based drugs; TPN macronutrients), with **safety IV catheters discussed as a potential sixth**.
- Proposed core deliverable: **blinded facility-level market share visualizations** using **three-digit ZIP codes** and **anonymized facility numbers** to show share/compliance patterns without naming facilities.
- A key use case is **sales enablement**: mapping compliance gaps geographically to help prioritize accounts, acknowledging that revealing facility identities requires permission and is **not scalable** across thousands of facilities.
- The team discussed how **Premier contracts** may include **spend-based and/or market-share-based compliance** requirements, often with **tiered pricing** tied to thresholds—an area suppliers are increasingly focused on.
- An additional opportunity area raised: **IV pump fleet age / replacement cycles** (pump life “typically defined as **10 years by AHA and FDA**”), using Premier-tracked purchases (past **seven years**) and supplier-reported sales for cross-validation.
- A **DEHP-free filter** was confirmed feasible: a **DEHP flag exists in the item master (PIM)** and is believed accurate for solutions and relevant to tubings (to be validated).
- Pricing and scope packaging were debated (initial proposal referenced **$250K**; internal view that six-category scope could be much higher), but **no final pricing decision** was recorded.
- Timeline intent: internal review Monday and send an updated proposal **before Thanksgiving**.

## 2) Meeting Context

- **Topic:** Expanding a custom analytic service for a client’s IV market analysis.
- **Shift in scope:** From IV fluids-only to a broader “triple play” / holistic IV therapy view.
- **Primary constraint:** Provide actionable facility-level insight while keeping identities blinded (scalable approach) and recognizing permission-based identification is possible but limited.

---

## 3) Key Decisions / Confirmations

- **Holistic category approach confirmed:** Proceed with analysis across **all five (or six)** IV therapy categories rather than a single-category (fluids-only) view.
- **Blinded facility-level method confirmed:** Use **3-digit ZIP + anonymized facility IDs** as the primary scalable facility-level visualization approach.
- **DEHP-free filter feasibility confirmed:** The **PIM DEHP flag exists** and can be used; a validation report from **PIM/Fusion** will confirm accuracy for solutions and tubings.
- **Proposal timing intent confirmed (proposed):** Internal review Monday; send revised proposal **before Thanksgiving**.

---

## 4) Open Questions / Follow-ups

- **Final scope:** Confirm whether the deliverable covers **five categories** or **five plus safety IV catheters (six)**. *(Unresolved in notes.)*
- **Pricing:** Determine final pricing and structure, given the client has already seen **$250K** and internal discussion suggested higher pricing for expanded scope. *(No final decision recorded.)*
- **Engagement structure:** Decide between a shorter-term/limited “chart/compliance view” across all categories vs. a broader full package. *(Options discussed; not finalized.)*
- **Facility identification:** Whether any portion should include named facilities via permission-based disclosure, and under what conditions. *(Scalability constraints noted; approach TBD.)*

---

## 5) Risks / Dependencies

- **Scope ambiguity (5 vs. 6 categories):** Risk of misalignment with client expectations until explicitly confirmed.
- **Pricing sensitivity:** Client has already seen **$250K**; raising price or changing packaging may create friction unless tied clearly to expanded value and deliverables.
- **Data/field validation dependency:** DEHP-free filtering depends on verifying the **PIM/Fusion** field accuracy for solutions and tubings.
- **Privacy/scalability constraint:** Named facility disclosure is possible with permission but **not scalable**; success of sales enablement use cases depends on acceptance of the blinded approach.
- **Pump fleet analysis limitations:** Premier can track purchases for the **past seven years** (not full 10-year life), so fleet-age estimates may be incomplete without careful framing.

Subject: Updated IV Therapy Analytics Proposal — Scope & Sample View

Hi [Client Name],  
Following our discussion, we’re updating the proposal to shift from a fluids-only view to a holistic IV therapy approach aligned to the “triple play” (bag/tubing/catheter), covering the relevant IV therapy categories.

We also plan to include blinded facility-level market share and compliance visualizations (3-digit ZIP + anonymized facility IDs) so your team can see geographic/compliance patterns at scale without revealing facility identities.

Two quick confirmations we’d like from you:
1) Should we include **safety IV catheters** as an additional category (i.e., five vs. six total categories)?  
2) Would you prefer a shorter-term compliance/visualization-focused package first, or the broader full analytics package from the start?

We’ll share an updated proposal (and a sample visualization) by **[date—unknown]** / before Thanksgiving as discussed.

Thanks,  
[Name]
