## 1) Executive Summary (6–10 bullets)

- B. Braun is seeking a **unit forecast at the product-family and monthly level** to better plan needs for **shared components**.  
- Product-family/month forecasting is viewed as **more accurate than SKU-level** and expected to **create less “nervousness”** in their planning system.  
- SKU-level variability can be **partially addressed via safety stocks**, reinforcing the preference for higher-level forecasting.  
- There is strong interest in **interpreting supply-chain “signals” and trends**; B. Braun needs help making sense of the data.  
- This creates a potential **service/consulting component** opportunity focused on signal interpretation (specific scope/tools **unknown**).  
- A key operational challenge is the **rapid acceleration of product-mix changes**, making demand planning harder.  
- Core demand-planning uncertainties include: **when elevated demand will decline** and **where demand may spike next**.  
- Planning is constrained by the fact that **some raw materials have long lead times**.  
- Relationship value is noted in B. Braun’s connection with **Karen & Premier** for insights into hospital dynamics and broader industry themes.

## 2) Meeting Context

- Source notes are referenced as “**Supply Shortage Prediction Notes.docx**” and “**8/12/22 Call With B. Braun**.”  
- The document also shows “**Monday, December 5, 2022 8:45 AM**” — **date context is unclear/unknown** (it is not confirmed whether this reflects the actual meeting date, a file timestamp, or a separate event).  
- Discussion focused on forecasting approach, demand-planning uncertainties, and how to use/interpret supply-chain signals to improve planning under product-mix volatility and lead-time constraints.

---

## 3) Key Decisions / Confirmations

- Confirmed preference/need: **unit forecast at the product family + month level** (instead of SKU-level).  
- Rationale confirmed in the notes: this approach is considered **likely more accurate** and expected to **reduce system nervousness**, with SKU-level variation managed via **safety stocks**.

---

## 4) Open Questions / Follow-ups

- Demand trajectory questions:
  - **When will high demand fall off?**
  - **Where is demand about to spike?**
- Signal interpretation support:
  - What specific **data sources**, **methods**, or **tools** should be used to interpret supply-chain signals is **unknown**.
  - What the **service/consulting component** entails (deliverables, cadence, responsibilities) is **unknown**.
- Forecasting implementation details:
  - Which **product families** and which definition/hierarchy to use is **unknown**.
  - Whether the forecast needs to be **statistical, judgmental, or hybrid** is **unknown**.

---

## 5) Risks / Dependencies

- **Rapidly changing product mix** may reduce forecast stability and increase planning complexity.  
- **Long lead times for some raw materials** create dependency on earlier, more reliable signal detection and forecasting.  
- The value of supply-chain signal trends depends on the ability to **interpret the data correctly**; lack of clarity on approach/tools is a dependency.  
- Reliance on insights from **Karen & Premier** is a relationship dependency (specific mechanism and continuity **unknown**).

## 6) Suggested Next-Step Email (short draft)

Subject: Next steps on product-family/month forecasting & supply signal interpretation

Hi [Name],  
Thank you again for the discussion. We understand B. Braun’s preference is for a **unit forecast at the product-family and monthly level** to support planning for **shared components**, with SKU-level variability managed via **safety stocks**.

As next steps, could we confirm:  
1) The **product-family hierarchy** you want to use (and which families to include first), and  
2) Which **supply-chain signals/data sources** you’re referencing today so we can propose an approach to **interpret trends** and highlight potential spikes or demand fall-off earlier.

Once we have that, we can outline a proposed forecasting output and a potential **signal-interpretation support** model (scope/cadence TBD).  
Best,  
[Your Name]
