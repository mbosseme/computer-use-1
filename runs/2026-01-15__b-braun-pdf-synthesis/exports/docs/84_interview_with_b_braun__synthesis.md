## 1) Executive Summary (6–10 bullets)

- Initial recommended focus is to **start with top-volume SKUs**.
- **Forecast accuracy is being undermined by mix changes** driven by **practice/physician preference** (e.g., a physician leaves a practice and the supplier is not notified).
- Current demand planning inputs include **historical data, standard SIOP, marketing “Market View” (18-month growth estimate), sales estimates, and seasonality**.
- Demand is **primarily distributor-driven and can be lumpy**; distributors are **blind to true Point of Sale (POS)** in the way retailers may have POS visibility (e.g., Walmart).
- Preferred planning outputs: **8–10 week forecast window** (8 weeks would help), **~5 weeks safety stock**, and **raw Excel output**; current forecasting is **monthly and split evenly across weeks**.
- Team confirmed a **deep-dive pilot**: focus on **regional anesthesia (epidurals)**, using the **same data Jennifer (Demand Planner) would receive**, and generate **weekly + monthly forecasts** at **SKU level** (and also for the overall group).
- An area of acute difficulty is **pain control / regional anesthesia** (Spine / Epidurals / Peripheral nerve block / Combined).
- Open questions include handling of a **large order sitting for 90 days** and understanding **duration of customer switching to alternatives**.
- Notes indicate **allocation/protection behavior** (“B. Braun tries to protect current customers by restricting / going on allocation”) and a supply disruption reference involving **Teleflex spilling over to B. Braun** (exact meaning unclear).

## 2) Meeting Context

Discussion centered on improving near-term forecasting and visibility for a distributor-driven demand environment. The team reviewed current planning inputs (SIOP, historical, marketing/sales views, seasonality), challenges caused by physician-driven mix shifts, and preferences for an actionable forecast horizon and format. The group aligned on running a targeted category pilot (regional anesthesia—epidurals) with outputs at both aggregated and SKU levels.

---

## 3) Key Decisions / Confirmations

- **Pilot approach confirmed:** Deep dive into **a single category (regional anesthesia—epidurals)**.
- **Data fidelity requirement:** The pilot should **show the data that Jennifer would actually receive**.
- **Forecasting granularity confirmed:**
  - Produce **monthly and weekly** forecasts.
  - Deliver outputs for the **whole group** and for **individual SKUs**.
- **SKU-level requirement:** “Need to have at SKU level if possible.”
- **Marketing focus confirmed:** “Focus on top volume SKUs initially.”

---

## 4) Open Questions / Follow-ups

- **Aged large order:** “Is this large order that has been sitting out there for 90 days still really needed? Has the hospital already received an alternate supply?”
- **Switching behavior:** When a hospital switches to an alternative (example mentioned: “if a BBraun alt?”), **how long do they stay with it before switching back**?
- **POS visibility:** Extent/availability of true **Point of Sale (POS) data** is **unknown**.
- **Supply disruption note clarity:** “Teleflex troubles spilled over to B. Braun, they current ramp up fast enough.” Meaning is **unclear** (needs confirmation).

---

## 5) Risks / Dependencies

- **Dependency:** Carmel (VP Sales) needs to provide the **full SKU list** to enable matching and forecasting.
- **Data limitation risk:** Distributor demand is **lumpy** and distributors are **blind to POS**, which may limit forecast accuracy and root-cause visibility.
- **Process risk:** Practice/physician-driven mix shifts can **rapidly invalidate historical patterns**, contributing to poor forecasts.
- **Operational risk:** If allocation/restriction is used to protect current customers, it may **distort demand signals** and complicate interpretation of order patterns.
- **Unknown supply disruption impacts:** The Teleflex/B. Braun note may imply constraints or volatility, but the **true impact is unknown** pending clarification.

## 6) Suggested Next-Step Email (short draft)

Subject: Next steps: Regional anesthesia (epidurals) forecasting deep dive + SKU list

Hi team,  
Per our discussion, we’ll start by focusing on top-volume SKUs and run a deep dive in **regional anesthesia (epidurals)**. We will use the same inputs Jennifer typically receives and produce forecasts at both **monthly and weekly** levels for the **overall group and individual SKUs** (SKU-level where possible), delivered in **raw Excel**.

**Action needed:** Carmel—can you please send the **list of all SKUs** so we can match and begin the category pilot?

Also, we’d like to confirm a couple of items:  
- The status/need for the **large order outstanding for ~90 days** (and whether the hospital sourced an alternative).  
- Any insight on **how long hospitals typically stay on an alternative** before switching back.  
- Whether any **POS data** is available (even partial).

Thanks,  
[Your Name]
