## 1) Executive Summary (6–10 bullets)

- B. Braun (Jennifer Gotto) reset expectations: B. Braun is **“not in a position to move toward a large-scale investment or full engagement”** of Premier’s Custom Analytics Services at this time.
- Near-term path (if any) must be **“a very limited, tightly scoped exploratory project (focused on a single category at the facility level)”** rather than a broad engagement.
- The purpose of a small pilot would be to **compare Premier’s dataset vs. B. Braun’s existing data** to determine whether incremental insights justify deeper engagement.
- Premier (Matthew Bossemeyer) requested direction on an engagement approach and offered a more detailed proposal; he suggested focusing Custom Analytics Services on the **“6 Category IV Ecosystem.”**
- Premier’s proposed data approach is to **combine “hospital ERP + Rx wholesaler data”** to create a more complete category spend picture.
- Previously discussed use cases remain on the table conceptually, but B. Braun confirmed they are **not pursuing the full set of use cases now** (e.g., leakage/compliance targeting and portfolio gap analysis) as part of the immediate effort.
- A key dependency to start validation is B. Braun providing a **CAPS SKU list**; Premier will then produce a sample cut and data dictionary for coverage validation.
- Pharmacy admixture representativeness is explicitly important to validate (Jake’s input to be captured).

## 2) Meeting Context

- Participants referenced: **Jennifer Gotto (B. Braun)**, **Matthew Bossemeyer (Premier)**, and **Jake (B. Braun)** (for pharmacy admixture representativeness feedback).
- Context: Follow-up after internal discussions at B. Braun to recalibrate scope and investment expectations for Premier Custom Analytics Services.
- Current posture: Exploration only—B. Braun needs time to assess value, understand complementarity with existing data sources, and build a longer-term business case (Jennifer noted she is **“still getting grounded in my role”**).

## 3) Key Decisions / Confirmations

- B. Braun confirmed that any near-term engagement must be **strictly exploratory and narrow**: **single category**, **facility-level**, and **not** a broad Custom Analytics Services engagement.
- Confirmed limitation: **“At this time, we would only explore a narrow, category-specific proof-of-concept and not the full set of use cases discussed last week.”**

## 4) Open Questions / Follow-ups

- **Pilot scope:** Which **single category** will the tightly scoped exploratory project focus on? *(Unknown)*
- **Inputs / timing:** When will B. Braun deliver the **CAPS SKU list** to enable Premier’s sample cut and validation? *(Unknown timeline)*
- **Optional add-ons:** Does B. Braun want to include **“Capital Refresh”** and/or **“DEHP/PVC-Free”** add-ons? (Jennifer indicated they are **not ready** to decide yet; Premier asked for a decision.)
- **Alignment call:** Will both parties hold a **30-minute sync next week** to align on the minimal pilot scope? *(Not confirmed)*

## 5) Risks / Dependencies

- **Dependency:** Pilot validation depends on B. Braun supplying the **CAPS SKU list**; without it, Premier cannot produce the sample cut for coverage validation.
- **Scope risk:** Misalignment on “minimal viable” pilot scope (single category, facility-level) could delay progress if not confirmed quickly.
- **Value realization risk:** Pilot may show limited incremental insight versus B. Braun’s current data sources, which would reduce the case for deeper engagement.
- **Data representativeness risk:** Pharmacy admixture coverage/representativeness must be validated; missing or skewed representation could undermine conclusions (Jake’s review noted as a priority).
- **Decision timing risk:** Unclear timing for decisions on optional add-ons (Capital Refresh, DEHP/PVC-Free) could create proposal churn.

## 6) Suggested Next-Step Email (short draft)

Subject: Next steps: narrow exploratory pilot scope + CAPS SKU list for sample validation

Hi Jennifer (and team),

Thank you for the update and for resetting expectations. We understand B. Braun is **not in a position to move toward a large-scale investment/full engagement** right now, and that any near-term work would need to be **a very limited, tightly scoped exploratory project (single category, facility-level)**.

To move forward with the exploratory validation:
1) Can you share the **CAPS SKU list** (or confirm when you expect to have it)? Once received, we’ll **produce the sample quickly** and include a **data dictionary** to validate coverage across **ERP + Rx wholesaler data**.  
2) Can we confirm the **single category** you’d like to focus on for the proof-of-concept?  
3) Are you open to a **30-minute sync next week** to align on the minimal pilot scope and success criteria (including capturing **Jake’s feedback on pharmacy admixture representativeness**)?

Separately, we can hold on **Capital Refresh** and **DEHP/PVC-Free** until you’re ready to decide.

Best,
