## 6) Suggested Next-Step Email (short draft)

Subject: Scheduling follow-up market data demo + next steps on Market Insights proposal

Hi Tracy and Jen,  
Thank you for the update. We understand you’d like a follow-up demo focused specifically on the market data capabilities with a smaller group.

Could you share (1) the key discussion points/questions you’d like us to address and (2) who you expect to include from the marketing team? In parallel, we’ll plan to incorporate any guidance Bill provides on the contract compliance program elements.

Our team can share availability in early 2026—are there preferred weeks/times we should prioritize?

Best,  
Anita Mouroutsos  
Premier, Inc.
