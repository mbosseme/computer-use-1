## 1) Executive Summary (6–10 bullets)

- There is **strong initial interest**, particularly from **Carmel (VP Sales)**, but momentum slowed when **Jennifer (demand planner)** went out on leave; a follow-up opportunity remains.
- The group aligned on a **next-step deep dive in a single category**—**regional anesthesia (epidurals)**—to show outputs in the format **Jennifer would actually receive**.
- Planning and forecasting are challenged by **practice/physician-driven mix changes** (e.g., a physician leaves and the supplier isn’t notified), leading to poor forecasts.
- Demand is largely **distributor-driven and “lumpy,”** and the team is **blind to Point of Sale**, complicating near-term visibility.
- Preferred operating parameters: **8–10 week forecast window** (8 weeks would help) and **~5 weeks safety stock**.
- Current process produces a **monthly forecast**, which is then **evenly divided across weeks**; stakeholders want better near-term issue visibility to support **manual modifiers**, including competitor impacts.
- Outputs should be **SKU-level if possible**, and **raw Excel data** is the preferred format.
- Key validation questions remain around **order validity** (“large order…sitting out there for 90 days”) and **switching behavior** (how long hospitals stay on alternatives before switching back).
- A potential legal/permissions dependency was raised: **whether hospitals have granted rights to use the data** (status unknown).

## 2) Meeting Context

- Discussion focused on improving demand planning/forecasting with emphasis on:
  - Near-term forecasting needs (8–10 week window) and inventory posture (5 weeks safety stock).
  - The reality of **distributor-driven demand** and lack of **POS visibility**.
  - Operational pain points driven by **mix shifts from clinical practice changes and physician preference**.
- A specific current struggle area was called out: **regional anesthesia** (Spine, Epidurals, Peripheral nerve block, Combined), with agreement to focus the next step on **epidurals**.
- Planning inputs used by Jennifer (demand planner) were noted: **Standard SIOP process, historical sales, “Market View” (marketing’s growth estimate over 18 months), sales team estimates, and seasonality**.

---

## 3) Key Decisions / Confirmations

- Agreed next step: **Dive deeply into a single category (regional anesthesia – epidurals)** and **show the data/output that Jennifer would actually receive**.
- Agreed analytical approach (as captured): **match data, then forecast at month level for 3 months out**, and perform analysis for the **whole group** plus **individual SKU level if time allows**.
- Confirmed preference/requirement signals:
  - **SKU-level detail** “if possible”
  - **Excel raw data** as best output format
  - **8–10 week forecast window** as ideal (8 weeks would help)

---

## 4) Open Questions / Follow-ups

- Order validity: Is the **“large order that has been sitting out there for 90 days”** still needed, or has the hospital already received **alternate supply**?
- Switching behavior: When hospitals switch to an alternative, **how long do they stay** before switching back?
- Data rights: **Have hospitals granted rights to use this data?** (permission status **unknown**)
- Operational follow-up: Re-engage on planning progress given **Jennifer’s leave** caused momentum loss (timeline/availability **unknown**).

---

## 5) Risks / Dependencies

- **Data rights / permissions risk:** Unclear whether hospital data can be used (must be confirmed before scaling analysis).
- **Dependency on SKU list:** Analysis depends on **Carmel sending the list of all SKUs**.
- **Data limitations:** Distributor-driven demand is **lumpy** and the team is **blind to POS**, which may constrain forecast accuracy and lead-time visibility.
- **Forecast instability risk:** **Practice changes and physician preference** can shift mix unexpectedly; supplier may not be notified when physicians change/leave.
- **Operational constraints:** Mentioned that “Teleflex troubles spilled over to B. Braun,” and B. Braun protects customers via **allocation/restricting**; supply constraints could distort observed demand signals.

## 6) Suggested Next-Step Email (short draft)

Subject: Next step: Regional anesthesia (epidurals) deep dive + SKU list

Hi [Name/Carmel/Jennifer],  
Thanks again for the discussion. As agreed, our next step is to **dive deeply into regional anesthesia—starting with epidurals**—and **show the data/output in the format Jennifer would receive** (preferably **raw Excel**), at **SKU level if possible**.

To proceed, could you please:
1) **Send the list of all SKUs** (Carmel), and  
2) Confirm the status of **data rights/permissions** (have hospitals granted rights to use this data?), and  
3) Clarify whether the **large order open for ~90 days** is still needed or if alternate supply was received.

Once we have the SKU list, we’ll **match the data and build a 3-month monthly forecast**, and where time allows include **individual SKU-level analysis**.

Best,  
[Your Name]
