## 1) Executive Summary (6–10 bullets)

- The document outlines **Premier Inc.’s 2025 “Market Insights” Data & Analytics** offering for medical device manufacturers, positioned to **grow revenue and maximize margin** through a shared, daily-updated data environment.
- The platform supports use cases spanning **market segmentation/account targeting**, **contract performance and portfolio analysis** (including **SURPASS** and **AscenDrive** compliance monitoring), **demand forecasting/inventory optimization**, and **channel partner (distributor) performance/SLA monitoring**.
- Data inputs include **PO, invoice, inventory, cross-reference, and master data**, representing the **U.S. acute care market**, with **daily updates** and a stated principle that **all stakeholders access the same data source**.
- A featured section covers **“Market Insights: B. Braun Awarded Contract Summary”** and a recommended Premier/B. Braun partnership that appears to include **continuation of a current subscription** and **proposed expansions/new engagements** (final approvals not explicitly stated).
- Reported B. Braun performance (US Acute Care, Premier only): **Total Revenue $299M (+18.5% YoY)**; market total revenue **$1.7B (+13.6% YoY)**; overall market share **17.6% (up from 16.8%)**.
- Supply chain indicators highlight competitive dynamics: B. Braun had **higher PO lines past due vs competition** (improving after early 2025), while **competition backorders/cancellations spiked in late 2024** and B. Braun remained lower.
- Demand disruption content references a post-event recovery (noted as **“pre-Helene levels”**) with **days of supply peaking ~33 (~2.2x pre-Helene)** and remaining elevated (~1.3x); purchasing suppression estimates are shown for **Q2 ’25 (8 days / ~8%)** and **Q3 ’25 (5 days / ~5%)**.
- Commercial targeting examples include a “whale account” approach (top 50 upside accounts) and a deliverable: **a prioritized “Target Action List” of blinded IDs mapped to Zip-3** for sales deployment.
- Pricing/investment references include **Current Investment (continues): $175,000/year**, plus **New Investment: $165,000/year (co-term with GPO contracts)** and **New Investment: $250,000 (6-month engagement)**; whether these new items were approved is **unknown**.

  - Provide a consolidated, shared data foundation for commercial, contracting, and supply chain decision-making.

  - Identify market opportunities and prioritize target accounts/segments.
  - Monitor supply disruption signals and guide forecasting/inventory actions.

## 3) Key Decisions / Confirmations

- **Continuation implied but not explicitly approved in text provided:**  
  - “**Current Investment (continues): $175,000/year**” and items labeled **“Currently Subscribe”** suggest ongoing services, but an explicit decision/approval statement is **unknown**.
- **No explicit approvals captured** for:
  - “**New Proposed Subscription**” items (approval status **unknown**).
  - “**IV Categories (6) – Custom analytics services**” 6-month engagement (approval status **unknown**).
  - Optional add-ons (approval status **unknown**).

---

## 4) Open Questions / Follow-ups

- Are the **“New Proposed Subscription”** items approved (yes/no **unknown**)?
- What is the **final scope, deliverables, milestones, and timeline** for **“IV Categories (6) – Custom analytics services”** beyond “6 Month engagement” (details **unknown**)?
- Who are the **named stakeholders/owners** on both Premier and B. Braun responsible for execution (names/roles mapping **unknown**)?
- What are the **specific actions and owners** in the referenced “Potential Next Steps — Premier Market Insights & B Braun” section (details **unknown**)?

---

## 5) Risks / Dependencies

- **Approval dependency:** Proposed expansions/new engagements (new subscriptions; 6-month custom analytics) appear contingent on internal approval—status **unknown**.
- **Operational dependency:** Successful analytics depends on integrating/maintaining data inputs (PO, invoice, inventory, cross-reference, master data) and ensuring stakeholders use the shared source (“all stakeholders access the same data source”).
- **Supply chain volatility risk:** The deck highlights shortage/availability dynamics (e.g., “Shortage Condition Score,” elevated days of supply post-disruption); ongoing variability could affect forecasting accuracy and commercial outcomes.
- **Contract/compliance execution risk:** Compliance monitoring for SURPASS/AscenDrive and specific contracts/categories implies dependencies on contract definitions, item cross-references, and aligned field execution.
- **Ambiguity risk:** Several sections imply next steps and investments but lack explicit decision records and named owners in the provided summary.

## 6) Suggested Next-Step Email (short draft)

Subject: Confirm scope & approvals for Premier Market Insights partnership items

Hi team,  
Based on the Market Insights materials, can we please confirm the following so we can finalize the execution plan?

1) Approval status for the **New Proposed Subscription** items (Regional Anesthesia Trays and Supplies **AD-OR-2538**; Safety IV Catheters **SP-NS-1627**) and the associated **$165K/year** new investment (co-termed with GPO contracts).  
2) Confirmation of the **IV Categories (6) – Custom analytics services** engagement (**$250K; 6 months**) including expected deliverables (e.g., **Name-Blind Market Share Map (Acute)**), milestones, and timeline.  
3) Named **owners/stakeholders** on both sides for contract compliance work and custom analytics delivery.  
4) Whether optional add-ons (**Capital Refresh Recency**, **DEHP/PVC-Free Targets**) should be included or deferred.

Once confirmed, we’ll circulate a concise project plan with dates and responsibilities.

Thanks,
