## 1) Executive Summary (6–10 bullets)

- Meeting attendees spanned Marketing, Corporate Supply Planning, Contracting, Demand Planning, Channel Management, Sales Operations, and Sales (see full list below).
- A key theme was **end-to-end visibility into service levels**, especially what customers actually experience.
- The group highlighted a visibility gap: companies may see **their own service levels to distributors**, but often **cannot see distributor service levels to health systems**.
- Participants emphasized the value of being able to see **service level trends over time** (how things are trending).
- Ongoing supply constraints/shortages were referenced as a long-standing issue (“been dealing with shortages for 10 years”).
- Notes include two items with unclear context—**“Intracan - follow up”** and **“Pain control - market leader”**—requiring clarification.
- The document references a **“B. Braun Demo 5/15/23”** (timestamp noted as Monday, May 15, 2023 10:03 AM); outcome/decisions from that demo are **unknown** from this chunk.

## 2) Meeting Context

**Participants and roles:**
- Peter McGregor — Marketing  
- John Gibbons — Corporate supply planning; manages supply planning (SOP); works with plants  
- Bill Miller — Contracting; manages Premier relationship  
- Jennifer Jordan — Demand planning  
- Len Bridgeman — Channel management team; “been dealing with shortages for 10 years”; works cross functionally  
- Jeremy How — Sales Operations; provides visibility into the post-manufacturing supply chain; works with HIRC on SRS to identify disruptions to supply chain  
- Carmel Veron — Sales  

**Stated themes / “What resonated”:**
- “We can see the service levels our customer's experience, which is the most important.”
- “They can see their service levels to their distributors, but they can't see the distributor's service levels to their health systems.”
- “We can see how things are trending.”

**Referenced item:**
- “B. Braun Demo 5/15/23” (Monday, May 15, 2023 10:03 AM)

## 3) Key Decisions / Confirmations

- **No explicit decisions or formal confirmations captured** in the provided chunk summary (unknown).

---

## 4) Open Questions / Follow-ups

- What is **“Intracan”**, and what specifically is required for the **follow-up**? (owner unknown)
- What does **“Pain control - market leader”** refer to (product, segment, company, or positioning), and what is the intended takeaway/action?
- What was the purpose and outcome of the **B. Braun demo (5/15/23)**? Any decisions, next steps, or stakeholder feedback are **unknown** from this chunk.

---

## 5) Risks / Dependencies

- **Visibility dependency:** Achieving end-to-end service-level insight appears to depend on access to data beyond the manufacturer’s direct view—specifically, **distributor-to-health-system service levels** (potential data sharing and integration risk).
- **Operational risk:** Persistent supply disruptions/shortages (“been dealing with shortages for 10 years”) may continue to impact service levels and planning effectiveness.
- **Information gaps:** “Intracan” and “Pain control - market leader” lack context; unresolved ambiguity may block progress or misalign priorities.

## 6) Suggested Next-Step Email (short draft)

Subject: Follow-ups: service-level visibility themes + open items (Intracan / Pain control)

Hi team,  
Thanks for the discussion. I captured a few follow-ups to confirm:

1) **Intracan** — what is the specific follow-up needed, and who owns it?  
2) **Pain control – “market leader”** — can someone confirm what this refers to and the intended takeaway/action?  
3) **Service-level visibility** — we aligned on the importance of seeing customer-experienced service levels and trends; can we confirm what data is available today vs. what’s missing (especially distributor → health system service levels)?

Also, the notes reference a **B. Braun demo on 5/15/23**—please share any outcomes/decisions and agreed next steps from that session.

Thank you,  
[Your Name]
