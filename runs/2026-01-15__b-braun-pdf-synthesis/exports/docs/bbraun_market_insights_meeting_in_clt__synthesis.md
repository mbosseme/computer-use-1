## 1) Executive Summary (6–10 bullets)

- B. Braun hosted the **“BBraun Market Insights Meeting in CLT”** on **11/3/2025 at 1:00 PM** (CLT-BET-340) to discuss **Market Insights (Supply Chain tech data)** and how to make insights more actionable.  
- The team was **highly receptive**, with strongest engagement from **Bill Miller, Anita Zado, and Tracy Butryn**, especially around **compliance analytics** and **services support**.  
- Two dominant priorities were reiterated throughout: **(1) Compliance (especially in IV)** and **(2) Patient safety**.  
- B. Braun expressed strong interest in a **“Live view”** to work proactively through a **current disruption**, plus broader **shortage radar** capabilities (drops/spikes, switching behavior, competitor recovery).  
- Proposed MI use cases spanned: **IV Solutions national compliance + forecasting**, **Safety IV Catheters conversion monitoring**, **Regional Anesthesia (NRFit) adoption mapping**, **distributor/channel SLA visibility**, **program performance (leakage/dual-award risk/clawbacks)**, and **ESG/safety benchmarking (PVC/DEHP-free, closed-system)**.  
- Delivery expectation: **family-level defaults**, **SKU drilldowns for exceptions**, **monthly refresh with alerting**, and outputs usable in **Excel + dashboards for QBRs**.  
- Data context: B. Braun currently uses **IQVIA data delivered in Power BI**, and it is **hard to obtain hospital data directly**; a **member-permission** approach (“Lindsay’s form”) and/or modeled **“expected spend”** were discussed to infer compliance.  
- Commercial confirmation: **Bill confirmed purchase of ~\$150K** for **two Performance Group (PG) data contracts** (**one data-only; one data + services**).  
- Scope confirmation: **IV/IV-therapy is a National-only agreement**, and B. Braun wants **compliance visibility across National accounts**; timing/reporting should align to **calendar fiscal year (new FY begins January)**.

## 2) Meeting Context

- **Meeting name:** “BBraun Market Insights Meeting in CLT”  
- **Date/time:** **11/3/2025, 1:00 PM**  
- **Location:** **CLT-BET-340** (address noted as **13520 Ballantyne Corporate Pl**); **Teams option** was provided  
- **Purpose:** Discuss Market Insights capabilities and support for **supply chain / market analytics**, with emphasis on turning insights into **actionable compliance and disruption responses**  
- **Engagement:** Most engaged participants: **Bill Miller, Anita Zado, Tracy Butryn**; overall tone: **highly receptive**

## 3) Key Decisions / Confirmations

- **Purchase confirmed:** Bill confirmed paying **~\$150K** for **two PG data contracts** (**one data-only; one data + services**).  
- **Priority alignment:** Compliance confirmed as **#1 priority** across **Bill/Anita/Tracy**, especially for **IV**.  
- **Agreement scope confirmed:** **IV/IV-therapy is National-only**, and B. Braun wants **National compliance visibility**.  
- **Cadence/timing confirmed:** Reporting should align to **calendar fiscal year**, with the new FY starting **January**.

## 4) Open Questions / Follow-ups

- **Outcomes linkage feasibility:** Can MI **“link compliance to clinical outcomes”** (e.g., compare **DEHP-free converted vs. non-converted** facilities/regions)? **Approach unknown.**  
- **Marketing evidence request:** Can MI show **“outcome or practice benefits for highly compliant IV-solutions portfolios”** to support marketing content? **Unknown.**  
- **Compliance gap drivers:** Bill requested the **“why” behind compliance gaps** (reasons hospitals buy on/off contract). **Taxonomy/method unknown.**  
- **National compliance modeling:** Details/accuracy of modeled **“expected spend” by hospital/IDN** to infer compliance. **Unknown.**  
- **Non-acute segmentation:** Best way to analyze **“OLM vs. independent split in non-acute”** and compare growth rates. **Definitions/data approach unknown.**  
- **Stakeholder expansion:** Which additional stakeholders (e.g., sales/marketing content owners) should be included and when. **Unknown.**  
- **NRFit pilot target:** Pilot metric includes **“+X pp NRFit penetration”**; **X is unknown**.

## 5) Risks / Dependencies

- **Hospital-level visibility dependency:** Since it’s **hard to obtain hospital data directly**, deeper compliance views may depend on **member-permission enablement** (“Lindsay’s form”) and/or acceptance of **modeled expected spend** approaches.  
- **Modeling/attribution risk:** Requests to tie **compliance → outcomes** and/or support **marketing claims** may be constrained by data availability and methodological limits (**feasibility unknown from notes**).  
- **Operational dependency on “Live view”:** The near-term disruption use case assumes ability to stand up timely **real-time/near-real-time monitoring** (exact data feeds/cadence not specified in notes).  
- **Timeline alignment:** Deliverables should fit a **January FY start**; timing risk if scoping/SOW is delayed.

## 6) Suggested Next-Step Email (short draft)

Subject: Next steps from BBraun Market Insights meeting (11/3) — compliance + disruption “live view”

Hi team,  
Thanks again for the discussion on 11/3. We captured that **compliance (especially IV)** and **patient safety** are the top priorities, and that a **“live view”** to work proactively through the current disruption would be immediately valuable.

Proposed next steps:
1) Share a **proposal for PG (including services) across all PG categories**.  
2) Draft a **SOW for the National (IV) compliance effort**, including how we’ll **triangulate gaps** and **measure typical volume by hospital type**.  
3) Confirm the preferred path for hospital-level visibility: **member-permission (“Lindsay’s form”)** vs. **modeled expected spend** (or both).  
4) Identify additional stakeholders to include (sales/marketing content owners); noting **Phil’s** openness to an in-person executive session in **Allentown, PA**.

If helpful, we can use the **current disruption** as the working example to define what the “live view” should include (alerts, dashboards, and Excel-ready outputs).  

Best,  
[Your Name]
