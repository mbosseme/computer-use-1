## 4) Open Questions / Follow-ups

  - What determines the **“qualifying tier”** (thresholds/commitments) for pricing activation?
- Tier detail visibility:
  - Detailed definitions/requirements for **Acute Tiers 1–5** and **Non-acute tiers** are **unknown** (table not fully visible in the summary).

## 5) Risks / Dependencies

- **Tier qualification dependency:** Member pricing depends on reaching/agreeing to a **qualifying tier**; requirements are not specified in the provided summary (risk of misalignment until clarified).
- **Administrative dependency:** Execution requires submission of **LOC and PMDF**; acronyms/contents are unknown, which may delay activation.
- **Channel constraints:** **Indirect-only** for disposables and **capital direct-only via authorized distributors** may affect procurement workflows or distributor alignment.
- **Technology limitation:** **Perfusor® PCA Syringe Pump has no wireless option**, which may impact integration/IT/clinical workflow expectations.
- **Claims verification:** Supply chain, safety, and performance claims (e.g., KLAS, PVC/DEHP) are stated but not fully qualified in the summary; may require documentation for internal review.
