Subject: Confirming rescheduled MI prep meeting + items to align on

Hi team,  
Per Anita’s note, the “Prep for Market Insights Pitch to B. Braun” meeting has been moved back by one week—can someone please confirm the updated date/time?

For the session, we still need to finalize the key areas to highlight in the MI pitch. Also, can we clarify what “Surpass” and “AscenDrive” refer to in the contract snapshot context?

Thanks,  
[Your Name]
