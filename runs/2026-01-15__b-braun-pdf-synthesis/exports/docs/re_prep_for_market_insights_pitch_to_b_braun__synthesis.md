## 1) Executive Summary (6–10 bullets)

- Team is preparing a **“Market Insights” pitch deck for B. Braun**, using a shared file: **“Market Insights - B Braun - Nov 2025.pptx”**.
- **Sachin Shah** will **reuse the deck presented to JnJ last week** as the starting point, and then **revise/update it for B. Braun** (noting it still referenced JnJ at the time).
- Contributors were asked to **add their sections directly into the shared deck**.
- The **Performance Groups (PG) team will own their slide section**; others should **coordinate with TiYany/PG before adding PG content**.
- **Audrey Siepiela** reviewed PG slides and **did not add more**, stating B. Braun has **“a few somewhat active users”** and additional screenshots beyond the existing **conversion explorer** slide did not seem necessary.
- **Tiffany (TiYany) Hughes** requested an **ETA for the deck framework** to enable timely insertion/review of her **contract performance slides** before the **Monday meeting** (ETA not provided in the available summary).
- The meeting invite included a **contract snapshot** for B. Braun: **29 active contracts; 4 SP and 4 AD; purchases 2 MSA offering**, plus example contract lines ($40k and $135k) (details below).
- Outstanding: whether **TiYany and Matt** believe anything is missing from the PG content is **unknown** based on the provided chunk.

## 2) Meeting Context

- **Format/source:** Email thread + meeting invite.
- **Purpose:** Prepare and finalize a **Market Insights pitch deck** tailored for **B. Braun**.
- **Working approach:** Start from a previously delivered **JnJ deck**, then edit/replace content to match B. Braun.
- **Timing:** References a **Monday meeting** (date/time **unknown** in the provided chunk).
- **Collaboration model:** Team members contribute sections directly in the shared PPT, with PG content managed/controlled by the PG team.

---

## 3) Key Decisions / Confirmations

- **Deck foundation confirmed:** Reuse the **JnJ deck from last week** as the baseline for B. Braun (owner: **Sachin Shah**).
- **Content ownership confirmed:** **PG team owns the PG slide section**; others should not add PG items without coordinating with **TiYany/PG**.
- **PG slide scope confirmed (for now):** **No additional PG screenshots** needed beyond existing content (per **Audrey Siepiela**, citing limited user activity).

---

## 4) Open Questions / Follow-ups

- **ETA needed:** When will the **deck framework** be ready for others—specifically to enable **TiYany** to add and get review time on **contract performance slides** before Monday? (**Unknown**)
- **PG completeness check:** Do **TiYany and Matt** think anything is missing from the PG section after Audrey’s review? (**Outcome unknown**)
- **Matt’s prep:** Matt said “I’m prepping this morning” — what deliverable/section this refers to is **unknown**.

---

## 5) Risks / Dependencies

- **Dependency on deck framework timing:** TiYany’s ability to insert and circulate **contract performance slides** depends on the **framework being available** with enough lead time before Monday.
- **Risk of stale references:** Starting from a deck that still referenced **JnJ** creates risk of **missed client-specific updates** if revisions aren’t completed thoroughly.
- **Coordination risk for PG content:** Since PG content is “owned” by PG, uncoordinated edits could create **version conflicts** or rework.

## 6) Suggested Next-Step Email (short draft)

Subject: B. Braun Market Insights Deck — framework ETA + section owners

Hi team,  
Quick check-in on the **“Market Insights - B Braun - Nov 2025.pptx”** deck.

- **Sachin**: can you share the **ETA for the updated deck framework** (JnJ → B. Braun revisions) so everyone can start dropping in final content?  
- Reminder: **PG team owns the PG section**—please **tag/reach out to TiYany** before adding PG-related updates.  
- **TiYany**: once the framework is ready, please add the **contract performance slides** so we have time for review ahead of **Monday**.

Thanks,  
[Your Name]
