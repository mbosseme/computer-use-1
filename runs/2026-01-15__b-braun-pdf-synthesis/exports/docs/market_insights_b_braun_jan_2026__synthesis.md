## 1) Executive Summary (6–10 bullets)

- Premier Inc. provided a **Jan 2026 “Market Insights / Data & Analytics”** overview of **Premier Market Insights (PMI)** for the **U.S. acute care market**, positioning PMI as a data + analytics capability for commercial, procurement, and supply chain use cases.  
- PMI is described as leveraging **PO, invoice, inventory, cross-reference, and master data** delivered via a **customized dashboard** with **daily data updates**.  
- The deck outlines a proposed **Premier / B. Braun Market Insights Partnership**: continue current compliance subscriptions, add expanded compliance subscriptions, and execute a **6-category IV custom analytics engagement (6 months; $250,000)**, with optional add-ons (selection **unknown**).  
- Current state appears to include existing compliance subscriptions for **Regional Anesthesia Trays and Supplies (SP-OR-2538)** and **Safety IV Catheters (AD-NS-2112)**.  
- Contract performance recommendations emphasize **Safety IV Catheter** monitoring (AscenDrive highlighted due to an incumbent dual-awarded supplier leaving the market) and note complexity in **Regional Anesthesia Trays** (custom tray exclusions).  
- The deck discourages prioritization of **Laparoscopic Surgical Instruments** and **Instrument Container** opportunities (“don’t recommend,” discretionary/limited opportunity; “N/A”/complex spend).  
- Example market performance metrics (Premier-only acute care view) cited: **B. Braun revenue $299M (+18.5% YoY)** vs **market $1.7B (+13.6% YoY)**; **market share 17.6% (up from 16.8%)**.  
- Supply/shortage and disruption examples include: **higher past-due PO line rates vs competition**, lower backorders/cancellations vs competitors late 2024, and a note that **Baxter products are projected to have the highest shortage risk** (per PMI projections).  
- Targeting concepts include a **“50 ‘Whale’ accounts”** action list and capital refresh segmentation (**PRIME TARGET / NURTURE / LOCKED**) plus optional **DEHP/PVC-free** targeting messaging (what will be used is **unknown**).  
- **Approval/commitment status is not stated** in the provided summary (i.e., the proposal is “recommended” but not explicitly confirmed as agreed).

## 2) Meeting Context

- This document is a **Premier Inc. PMI (Market Insights / Data & Analytics) deck** dated **Jan 2026** focused on the **U.S. acute care market**.  
- It describes PMI’s **data assets** (PO/invoice/inventory/cross-reference/master data), **delivery mechanism** (custom dashboards), and **daily refresh cadence**, alongside example analytics and use cases.  
- It frames a **partnership proposal with B. Braun** centered on compliance monitoring and IV-category analytics, plus optional add-ons.  
- Specific meeting date/attendees and whether this was a live meeting vs. a proposal leave-behind are **unknown**.

## 3) Key Decisions / Confirmations

- **Currently in place (appears confirmed as “Currently Subscribe”):**
  - **Regional Anesthesia Trays and Supplies (SP-OR-2538)** – currently subscribed  
  - **Safety IV Catheters (AD-NS-2112)** – currently subscribed
- **Supplier overview noted (status appears descriptive, not a decision):**
  - “Current Contract Awards **29 active contracts**… **4 SURPASS** and **4 AscenDrive**”
  - “Currently Purchases **2 MSA Offering**” (data only / data + support)
- **Not confirmed in the text (recommended but not explicitly approved):**
  - Expansion via new subscriptions: **Regional Anesthesia Trays and Supplies (AD-OR-2538)** and **Safety IV Catheters (SP-NS-1627)**  
  - **6-category IV custom analytics engagement** (**$250,000; 6 months**)  
  - Optional add-ons (e.g., **capital refresh recency**, **DEHP/PVC-free targeting**) — selection **unknown**

---

## 4) Open Questions / Follow-ups

- Are B. Braun and Premier **approving** the proposed expansion items and the **$250,000 / 6-month** custom analytics engagement? (**Unknown**)  
- What is the **final scope and deliverable list** for **“IV Categories (6) – Custom analytics services”** beyond the examples shown? (**Unknown**)  
- Which **optional add-ons** (Capital Refresh Recency; DEHP/PVC-Free Targets) are desired and in what timeline? (**Unknown**)  
- The deck references **“Potential Next Steps”** (page 29 header mentioned), but the specific steps are **not provided** in the summary—what are they? (**Unknown**)  
- For contract performance priorities: confirm whether B. Braun wants to prioritize **Safety IV Catheter / AscenDrive** monitoring given the cited dual-award supplier change and associated risk.

---

## 5) Risks / Dependencies

- **Contract performance / share risk:** The deck flags that an **alternate supplier activated 10/1 as the new dual awarded supplier**, which **could put current volume at risk** due to a new option being available.  
- **Category data complexity:** **Regional Anesthesia Trays** performance analysis is described as complicated due to **exclusion of custom trays**, which may limit straightforward comparisons and require careful interpretation.  
- **Supply chain performance perception:** PMI examples indicate **B. Braun past-due PO line rates** are consistently higher than competition (even while backorders/cancellations were lower), which could affect stakeholder confidence unless addressed/monitored.  
- **Dependency on data + enablement:** Proposed outcomes (e.g., “Target Action List,” Zip-3 sales deployment, “50 Whale accounts”) depend on timely data delivery, alignment on targeting criteria, and adoption by sales/commercial teams (owners not specified).  
- **Unconfirmed scope/investment:** The expanded subscriptions and $250K engagement are described as “new investment,” but approval status and timing are **unknown**, creating planning dependency.

## 6) Suggested Next-Step Email (short draft)

Subject: Next steps on Premier Market Insights partnership (Jan 2026 deck)

Hi [Name],  
Thank you for reviewing the Premier Market Insights (PMI) overview and the proposed Premier / B. Braun Market Insights partnership.

To confirm next steps, could you please advise on:  
1) Whether you’d like to proceed with the proposed expansions to compliance subscriptions (Regional Anesthesia Trays and Supplies **AD-OR-2538**; Safety IV Catheters **SP-NS-1627**) in addition to the current subscriptions (**SP-OR-2538** and **AD-NS-2112**).  
2) Whether you’d like to move forward with the **6-month / $250,000** “IV Categories (6)” custom analytics engagement, and the specific deliverables you want prioritized.  
3) Whether you want to include either optional add-on: **Capital Refresh Recency** and/or **DEHP/PVC-free targeting**.

If helpful, we can set up a working session to align on scope, success metrics, and deployment of the “Target Action List” (including the “50 Whale accounts” approach).
