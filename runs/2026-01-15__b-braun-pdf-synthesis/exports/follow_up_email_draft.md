**Subject:** Follow-up on Category IV Ecosystem analytics + next steps from Jan 9

Hi Tracy and Jennifer,  

Thank you again for the time last Friday (Jan 9). I wanted to check in as you complete your internal debrief and see where you’re leaning on an engagement approach so we can move toward a more detailed proposal.

Based on our conversation—and the broader theme we’re hearing across B. Braun of closing the visibility gap between **true demand/contract performance** and **operational planning in a shortage‑prone environment**—it sounds like the strongest near-term fit is the **Custom Analytics Services** work across the **6 Category IV Ecosystem** (Infusion Devices, Sets, Safety IV Catheters, IV Fluids & TPN, Needleless Connectors, Pharmacy & Admixture). Our aim would be to translate ERP + wholesaler signals into facility-level “where to act” outputs (market share map, opportunity targets, compliance leakage/root-cause views) that are usable in QBRs and field execution.

A few quick follow-ups on the action items:  
1) **Internal debrief / engagement path:** Have you aligned on whether you want to start with the 6-month Custom Analytics engagement (and how you’d like it to ladder into ongoing support)? If helpful, I can send a tighter 1–2 page scope with deliverables, refresh cadence, and sample views.  
2) **SKU list for CAPS/compounding sample cut:** Where are things with the request to **Claire Concowich** for the specific SKU list? Once we have that, we can turn the sample cut quickly and use it to validate the outputs and level of detail.  
3) **“What’s informing the outputs” (Data Dictionary):** We can provide a data dictionary/logic companion that documents key fields (ERP, Rx wholesaler), mapping methodology, inclusion/exclusion rules, and any assumptions—so your teams can validate what’s driving the results. If you tell me your preferred format (PowerPoint vs. Excel), we’ll tailor it.

To keep momentum, would you be open to a **30-minute working session next week** to confirm:  
- which of the **6 categories** to prioritize first (or whether we stand them up in parallel),  
- the initial outputs you want to socialize internally (e.g., national share map + top conversion targets), and  
- any add-ons you want priced now (e.g., **Capital Refresh Recency**, **DEHP/PVC‑Free targets**).

If you share a couple times that work, I’ll coordinate. Alternatively, I can send a revised proposal outline first and we can react asynchronously.

Best regards,
