# Re: Confirmed — B. Braun MI Demo (Virtual) — Synthesis

Generated on: 2026-01-16
Source file: Re: Confirmed-BBraun MI Demo - virtual .pdf
Redundancy-detected: False

## 1) Executive Summary (5–8 bullets)

- BBraun communicated they are **not ready for a large-scale investment or full engagement** of Premier’s Custom Analytics Services at this time.
- BBraun requested a **reset of expectations** while internal stakeholders assess value, overlap with existing data sources, and a longer-term business case.
- If proceeding near term, BBraun would only consider a **very limited, tightly scoped exploratory pilot**: **single category**, **facility-level** proof-of-concept.
- Purpose of the pilot: **evaluate data usefulness**, identify **gaps filled vs. existing information**, and determine whether **incremental insights** justify broader engagement later.
- Premier had proposed Custom Analytics Services focused on the **“6 Category IV Ecosystem”**, combining **hospital ERP + Rx wholesaler data** to create a complete spend picture.
- Two use cases discussed on the prior call (per Premier recap): **(1) leakage/cross-sell/compliance gaps** and **(2) portfolio gap analysis**—but BBraun is currently limiting scope to a narrow category-specific POC.
- BBraun is **still gathering the CAPS SKU list** needed for Premier to generate a **sample data cut** (with a data dictionary) for validation.

## 2) Meeting Context (who/what/when; any logistics)

- **What:** “BBraun MI Demo – virtual” (Microsoft Teams); Premier shared slides (attached in thread; content not included in source).
- **When:** **Jan 9, 2026, 1:00–2:30 PM** (time zone not explicitly stated in invite; likely Eastern based on email headers, but **unknown**).
- **Who (from email thread):**
  - **Premier:** Matthew Bossemeyer; CC: Anita Mouroutsos, Lindsay Schmidt, Sachin Shah, Audrey Siepiela
  - **BBraun:** Jennifer Gotto; Tracy Butryn; Jake Astarita (listed in “To:” line on Jen’s email)
  - Mentioned: “Claire/Jake” in relation to SKU list (Claire’s full identity/title **unknown**).
- **Logistics (from invite):** Microsoft Teams Meeting; Meeting ID and dial-in details provided in source.

## 3) Key Decisions / Confirmations

- **Confirmed:** BBraun will **not** pursue a **full engagement / large-scale investment** in Custom Analytics Services in the immediate term.
- **Confirmed:** Any near-term work must be a **small, tightly scoped exploratory pilot** limited to **one category at the facility level**.
- **Confirmed:** BBraun is **not ready** to scope **multiple use cases** or consider **add-ons** (explicitly: **Capital Refresh**, **DEHP/PVC-Free**) at this time.
- **Confirmed (process):** A **sample data cut** is contingent on BBraun providing the **CAPS SKU list**; Premier indicated they can produce it quickly once received and include a **data dictionary**.

## 4) Open Questions / Follow-ups (include owners if stated)

- **CAPS SKU list needed for sample cut**  
  - **Owner:** BBraun (referenced as “Claire/Jake”; also Jen states they are still gathering it)  
  - **Status:** In progress; timing **unknown**.
- **Define scope of the “very small initial pilot”** (single category; facility-level)  
  - **Owner:** Joint (BBraun + Premier)  
  - **Next step proposed:** A **short call next week** (Jen) / **30-minute sync next week** (Matt). Exact date/time **unknown**.
- **Which initial use case (within the narrow POC) to pursue**  
  - **Owner:** BBraun (Jen indicates only narrow POC; specifics not yet selected)  
  - **Status:** To be aligned on next call.
- **Validation focus: pharmacy admixture representativeness**  
  - **Owner:** Jake (per Premier note: “Jake’s feedback…is a priority”)  
  - **Dependency:** Requires sample cut.

## 5) Risks / Dependencies

- **Dependency:** Delivery of the **CAPS SKU list**; without it, Premier cannot produce the **sample data cut** for validation.
- **Risk:** BBraun perceives significant **overlap with existing data sources**, reducing incremental value and limiting likelihood of broader engagement.
- **Risk:** Internal BBraun alignment and prioritization may delay or constrain scope (“still getting grounded in my role,” “more time to assess”).
- **Risk:** Misalignment on expectations if Premier continues planning for broader/multi-use-case engagement while BBraun requires a strictly exploratory pilot.

## 6) Suggested Next-Step Email (draft a short reply)

Subject: Re: Confirmed – BBraun MI Demo (virtual) | Next steps for small pilot

Hi Jen,  

Thank you for the clear reset and context. We understand you’re not in a position to move forward with a broader Custom Analytics engagement right now, and we’re aligned to keep any near-term work strictly exploratory and tightly scoped.

If you’re open to it, we can set up a 30-minute call next week to define the smallest possible pilot (single category, facility-level) and confirm what “success” looks like for the evaluation. Once you’re able to share the CAPS SKU list, we’ll turn around the sample data cut quickly and include a data dictionary for validation (including the pharmacy admixture representativeness check Jake flagged).

Please let us know a couple of times that work next week, and we’ll send an invite.  

Best,  
Matt
