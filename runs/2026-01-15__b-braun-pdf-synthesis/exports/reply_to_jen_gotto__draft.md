Hi Jen,

Thank you for the thoughtful note and for the time last Friday. Totally understood on keeping this near-term work exploratory and tightly scoped as you assess how our data compares to sources you already have and what the incremental business value could be.

We’re very open to starting with a small pilot that’s deliberately sized to be useful for your commercial teams (so you can actually pressure-test accuracy/coverage and decision utility), but not so large that it creates undue risk or slows your internal process.

If you’re open to it, I’d suggest a quick 20–30 minute working session next week to align on the smallest possible pilot (single category, facility-level) and agree on success criteria up front.

**A couple of illustrative “pilot slices” (single-category, facility-level):**

1) **Facility-level competitor/coverage + opportunity view in one IV Ecosystem category** (e.g., Safety IV Catheters *or* Infusion Sets/Accessories)
   - Goal: validate coverage + accuracy at the facility level, and show one or two concrete opportunity lenses (e.g., market share / competitor mix / leakage signals) your team can compare against what you already receive.
   - Output: a de-identified facility cohort (IDs only) defined via a small acute-care sample and/or segment (with state + ZIP3 where available), plus a short readout and a data dictionary/attribute list so you can validate what’s driving the view.

2) **CAPS / compounding (503B) category validation slice** (once the SKU list is available)
   - Goal: use the CAPS SKU list to confirm representativeness and competitor visibility for compounding/nutrition/anesthesia-related SKUs, and explicitly compare what shows up via ERP purchasing vs wholesaler tracings.
   - Output: a validation cut + coverage report (what we can/can’t see, where it’s coming from), plus a small de-identified facility-level rollup (ID + state/ZIP3) that helps you judge incremental value.

We can keep this to a short, contained engagement (on the order of ~8–12 weeks) with a clear go/no-go decision point at the end.

If helpful, I can send over a 1–2 page pilot brief in advance (scope, deliverables, and the specific success criteria you care about) so the next call is efficient.

**Proposed times next week (Matt + Sachin):**
- Tue Jan 20: 9:30–10:00, 10:00–10:30, 12:00–12:30, 12:30–1:00, 1:30–2:00 ET
- Thu Jan 22: 9:30–10:00, 10:00–10:30, 11:00–11:30, 11:30–12:00, 12:30–1:00, 1:00–1:30 ET

If none of those work, feel free to send a couple windows that are convenient on your end and we’ll align.

Thanks again, and congrats again on the Bills win.

Best,
Matt
