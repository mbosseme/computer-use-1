## Executive Summary (8–12 bullets)

- B. Braun’s core need across workstreams is **better demand/supply visibility that is actionable**, spanning forecasting, disruption monitoring, and downstream service levels (81222 Call With B. Braun.pdf; B. Braun Demo 51523.pdf; BBraun Market Insights Meeting in CLT.pdf).
- Forecasting pain is driven by **rapid product-mix shifts** (often clinician/practice-driven) and **lumpy distributor-driven demand**, compounded by limited POS visibility (84 Interview With B. Braun.pdf; B Braun Legacy Notes.pdf).
- There is tension in preferred forecasting granularity: one thread emphasizes **product-family/monthly forecasts** to reduce planning “nervousness” and manage shared components (81222 Call With B. Braun.pdf), while another confirms a **SKU-level weekly+monthly pilot** for a specific category (regional anesthesia/epidurals) (84 Interview With B. Braun.pdf; B Braun Legacy Notes.pdf).
- B. Braun repeatedly signals interest in interpreting **“signals”** (drops/spikes, switching behavior, competitor recovery) and establishing a **“live view”** for disruptions/shortage radar (81222 Call With B. Braun.pdf; BBraun Market Insights Meeting in CLT.pdf).
- Compliance and patient safety emerge as top commercial/strategic priorities, especially in IV-related categories, with strong interest in facility-level (but privacy-safe) analytics (BBraun Market Insights Meeting in CLT.pdf; Premier Market Insights — Compliance Measurement & Monitoring Support for Suppliers.pdf).
- Premier’s Market Insights proposition is anchored in **ERP purchasing data** (plus distributor/wholesaler tracings in some views), delivered via dashboards and/or data feeds; key limitations include **purchase ≠ usage** and **no facility-level pricing** (BbraunPremier Market Insights -virtual.pdf; Confirmed-BBraun MI Demo - virtual.pdf).
- A recurring implementation constraint is **facility identity permissions**: scalable approaches default to **name-blind outputs** (Zip-3 + anonymized IDs) with named visibility only by member permission (B Braun Follow Up.pdf; Premier Market Insights — Compliance Measurement & Monitoring Support for Suppliers.pdf; Confirmed-BBraun MI Demo - virtual.pdf).
- Commercial posture evolves: purchase of **~$150K for two PG data contracts** (data-only + data+services) was confirmed (BBraun Market Insights Meeting in CLT.pdf), but later B. Braun states they are **not ready for a large-scale investment**, preferring a **tightly scoped single-category facility-level exploratory pilot** to validate incremental value (Re: Confirmed-BBraun MI Demo - virtual .pdf).
- IV therapy “ecosystem” framing (including the “triple play” bag/tubing/catheter) is a consistent lens for analytics and go-to-market enablement, with proposed expansion from fluids to broader categories (B Braun Follow Up.pdf; Confirmed-BBraun MI Demo - virtual.pdf).
- Data validation and taxonomy alignment are gating items: multiple notes call for **SKU lists**, **data dictionaries/attribute lists**, and crosswalks to ensure category coverage (especially CAPS/compounding/nutrition) (84 Interview With B. Braun.pdf; Confirmed-BBraun MI Demo - virtual.pdf; Re: Confirmed-BBraun MI Demo - virtual .pdf).
- Contract/portfolio context remains relevant: B. Braun positions as a “full line supplier” across IV categories with defined channel/contract mechanics; however, several contract activation details (tiers, LOC/PMDF) and claim substantiation needs are unresolved (B Braun Presentation_IV Therapy Portfolio_Group Purchasing.pdf).

---

## Themes (with evidence references)

### 1) Demand planning under volatility: mix shifts, distributor lumpiness, limited POS
- **Mix changes** (practice/physician preference; supplier not notified) degrade forecast accuracy (84 Interview With B. Braun.pdf; B Braun Legacy Notes.pdf).
- Demand is **distributor-driven and lumpy**, and B. Braun lacks **true POS visibility** downstream (84 Interview With B. Braun.pdf; B Braun Legacy Notes.pdf; B. Braun Demo 51523.pdf).

### 2) Forecasting granularity: product-family stability vs SKU-level actionability
- Preference for **product-family + monthly** unit forecasting to plan shared components and reduce system “nervousness,” with SKU variance handled by safety stocks (81222 Call With B. Braun.pdf).
- Separately, a confirmed pilot requires **weekly + monthly SKU-level forecasts** (and group rollup) for **regional anesthesia (epidurals)**, starting with top-volume SKUs (84 Interview With B. Braun.pdf; B Braun Legacy Notes.pdf).

### 3) Disruption “signals,” shortage radar, and a “live view”
- Strong interest in interpreting supply-chain **signals/trends** to anticipate spikes and the timing of demand normalization (81222 Call With B. Braun.pdf).
- Market Insights discussions emphasize a **“Live view”** to proactively manage an active disruption and broader **shortage radar** (switching behavior, competitor recovery) (BBraun Market Insights Meeting in CLT.pdf).

### 4) End-to-end service level visibility (manufacturer → distributor → health system)
- Need to see **what customers actually experience**, not just manufacturer service to distributors; explicit gap is visibility into **distributor service levels to health systems** and trends over time (B. Braun Demo 51523.pdf).
- Channel partner/distributor SLA monitoring is also positioned as a Market Insights use case (BBraun Market Insights Meeting in CLT.pdf; Market Insights - B Braun - Nov 2025.pdf).

### 5) Compliance analytics as a top priority (especially IV) with privacy-safe design
- Compliance is repeatedly stated as **#1 priority**, alongside patient safety (BBraun Market Insights Meeting in CLT.pdf).
- Proposed compliance method: monthly measurement by category/site/department, honoring tier language; **leakage** defined as off-contract competitor volume; default **name-blind** governance with permission-based named visibility (Premier Market Insights — Compliance Measurement & Monitoring Support for Suppliers.pdf).
- Facility-level visuals are designed to be scalable via **Zip-3 + anonymized facility IDs** (B Braun Follow Up.pdf; Confirmed-BBraun MI Demo - virtual.pdf).

### 6) IV “triple play” / IV ecosystem and expansion beyond fluids
- Client explicitly requested emphasis on **bag/tubing/catheter**; fluids described as least important economically (“don’t make us any money”) (B Braun Follow Up.pdf).
- “Triple play” is also used as a cross-sell/portfolio gap framework in Market Insights discussions (Confirmed-BBraun MI Demo - virtual.pdf).

### 7) Data foundations, constraints, and integration expectations
- Premier positions Market Insights as built from **hospital ERP transactions**, supplemented by distributor invoices and pharmacy wholesaler tracings; app may lag wholesale inclusion (BbraunPremier Market Insights -virtual.pdf; Confirmed-BBraun MI Demo - virtual.pdf).
- Key constraints: cannot see **point-of-use/usage**, only purchasing attribution; **no facility-level pricing**; PO/receipt pricing excludes rebates (BbraunPremier Market Insights -virtual.pdf; Confirmed-BBraun MI Demo - virtual.pdf).
- B. Braun interest in integrating data into internal tooling (e.g., **Databricks/Power BI**) is noted, alongside requests for **Excel exports** and raw outputs (84 Interview With B. Braun.pdf; BbraunPremier Market Insights -virtual.pdf).

### 8) Commercial scope/investment uncertainty and “pilot-first” posture
- A purchase of **~$150K for two PG data contracts** (data-only + data+services) is confirmed (BBraun Market Insights Meeting in CLT.pdf).
- Multiple decks propose expanded subscriptions and a larger **$250K / 6-month IV analytics engagement**, but approval is not consistently confirmed (Market Insights - B Braun - Nov 2025.pdf; Market Insights - B Braun - Jan 2026.pdf).
- Most recent stance: B. Braun is **not ready for large-scale investment**; wants a **minimal, single-category pilot** to compare Premier vs existing data (Re: Confirmed-BBraun MI Demo - virtual .pdf).

### 9) Patient safety and materials attributes (DEHP/PVC-free) as analytic dimensions
- Patient safety is repeatedly elevated as a top priority (BBraun Market Insights Meeting in CLT.pdf).
- DEHP-related analytics appear as both a **filtering capability** (DEHP flag in item master) and a proposed benchmarking dimension; validation is required (B Braun Follow Up.pdf; Market Insights - B Braun - Jan 2026.pdf).
- Requests include potentially linking conversion/compliance to outcomes, but feasibility is unknown (BBraun Market Insights Meeting in CLT.pdf).

## Notable Decisions / Confirmations

- **Forecasting preference (planning stability):** product-family + monthly unit forecast preferred over SKU-level to reduce “nervousness” (81222 Call With B. Braun.pdf).
- **Category pilot confirmed (forecasting):** deep dive in **regional anesthesia (epidurals)** using the same data the demand planner receives; produce **weekly + monthly** forecasts at **SKU level (if possible)** and group rollup; start with top-volume SKUs (84 Interview With B. Braun.pdf; B Braun Legacy Notes.pdf).
- **Market Insights priorities confirmed:** compliance (especially IV) and patient safety (BBraun Market Insights Meeting in CLT.pdf).
- **Commercial confirmation:** Bill confirmed payment of **~$150K** for **two PG data contracts** (one data-only; one data+services) (BBraun Market Insights Meeting in CLT.pdf).
- **IV therapy analytics approach (custom service):** shift from fluids-only to a broader IV-therapy view emphasizing “triple play”; scalable facility visualization via **Zip-3 + anonymized IDs** (B Braun Follow Up.pdf).
- **Privacy-safe compliance model confirmed (Premier framing):** name-blind by default; named visibility only via explicit member permission; monthly reporting with dashboards + CSV/Excel (Premier Market Insights — Compliance Measurement & Monitoring Support for Suppliers.pdf).
- **B. Braun engagement posture reset:** not ready for large-scale custom analytics; near-term must be a **tightly scoped single-category, facility-level exploratory project** (Re: Confirmed-BBraun MI Demo - virtual .pdf).
- **Governance/POCs:** Tracy Butryn and Jennifer Gotto are primary points of contact for the market-data-focused assessment; Jennifer Gotto leads the market insights/analytics team (Fw Following up.pdf).

---

## Open Questions / Follow-ups

- **Forecasting design conflicts to resolve:**
  - Should near-term operational forecasting prioritize **product-family/monthly** or **SKU-level weekly** outputs (or a hybrid split: family default + SKU exceptions)? (81222 Call With B. Braun.pdf; 84 Interview With B. Braun.pdf; BBraun Market Insights Meeting in CLT.pdf)
- **Distributor/POS visibility gaps:**
  - Whether any **true POS** (or proxy) is available and how to incorporate it (84 Interview With B. Braun.pdf; B Braun Legacy Notes.pdf).
  - How to obtain/estimate **distributor → health system service levels** and trend them (B. Braun Demo 51523.pdf).
- **Disruption analytics specifics:**
  - What constitutes the required **“Live view”** (alerts, cadence, signals, thresholds, owners) (BBraun Market Insights Meeting in CLT.pdf).
  - How to measure and interpret **switching behavior** during shortages and time-to-switch-back (84 Interview With B. Braun.pdf; B Braun Legacy Notes.pdf; BBraun Market Insights Meeting in CLT.pdf).
- **Data permissioning & rights:**
  - Status/process for **hospital permissions/data rights** (including “Lindsay’s form” and Premier’s national permission form), and timelines (B Braun Legacy Notes.pdf; BBraun Market Insights Meeting in CLT.pdf; Premier Market Insights — Compliance Measurement & Monitoring Support for Suppliers.pdf).
- **Pilot scope definition (current gating item):**
  - Which **single category** will anchor the exploratory facility-level pilot (Re: Confirmed-BBraun MI Demo - virtual .pdf).
  - When B. Braun will deliver the **CAPS SKU list** for coverage validation (Confirmed-BBraun MI Demo - virtual.pdf; Re: Confirmed-BBraun MI Demo - virtual .pdf).
- **IV-therapy analytics scope/pricing ambiguity:**
  - Whether IV analytics should cover **5 vs 6 categories** (safety IV catheters as potential sixth), and final packaging/pricing (B Braun Follow Up.pdf).
  - Approval status for proposed larger investments (e.g., **$250K / 6 months**) remains unclear across decks (Market Insights - B Braun - Nov 2025.pdf; Market Insights - B Braun - Jan 2026.pdf; Re: Confirmed-BBraun MI Demo - virtual .pdf).
- **Contract/portfolio mechanics clarity:**
  - Meaning and requirements of **LOC** and **PMDF**, and tier qualification thresholds (B Braun Presentation_IV Therapy Portfolio_Group Purchasing.pdf).
- **Data methodology clarity:**
  - How “standardized dollars (fixed weights)” are computed (Premier Market Insights — Compliance Measurement & Monitoring Support for Suppliers.pdf).
  - Whether and how MI could credibly link compliance/conversion (e.g., DEHP-free) to outcomes or marketing claims (BBraun Market Insights Meeting in CLT.pdf).

## Recommended Next Actions

1. **Lock the minimal pilot scope (1 page):** confirm the **single category**, facility-level outputs, success criteria (what “incremental insight” means vs B. Braun’s current data), and a delivery timeline (Re: Confirmed-BBraun MI Demo - virtual .pdf).
2. **Trigger data validation prerequisites immediately:**
   - Obtain **CAPS SKU list** (and any other priority SKU sets) and request Premier’s **Excel sample cut + data dictionary/attribute list** (Confirmed-BBraun MI Demo - virtual.pdf; Re: Confirmed-BBraun MI Demo - virtual .pdf).
3. **Reconcile forecasting operating model:** define a two-tier approach proposal (e.g., **family/month default + SKU exception drilldowns**) aligned to B. Braun’s expressed preferences for horizon (8–10 weeks), safety stock posture (~5 weeks), and raw Excel outputs (81222 Call With B. Braun.pdf; 84 Interview With B. Braun.pdf; B Braun Legacy Notes.pdf; BBraun Market Insights Meeting in CLT.pdf).
4. **Define the “Live view” requirements for disruptions:** agree on the specific signals (drops/spikes, switching, competitor recovery), cadence (monthly refresh + alerts vs near-real-time), and who operationalizes the actions (BBraun Market Insights Meeting in CLT.pdf).
5. **Clarify permissioning/legal path:** document which analyses require **named facilities**, which can remain **name-blind**, and the concrete process/timing for permission forms (Premier national permission form / “Lindsay’s form”) (Premier Market Insights — Compliance Measurement & Monitoring Support for Suppliers.pdf; BBraun Market Insights Meeting in CLT.pdf).
6. **Confirm stakeholder map and governance:** formalize Tracy Butryn + Jennifer Gotto as POCs for market data workstream; identify owner for compliance program elements and the cross-functional “other funnels” (demand, channel partners) request (Fw Following up.pdf; RE: BBRAUN - market insights meeting in November.pdf).
7. **Close known ambiguity items quickly:** request clarification on “Intracan” follow-up and “Pain control - market leader” notes, and confirm any linkage to the regional anesthesia forecasting pain point (B. Braun Demo 51523.pdf; 84 Interview With B. Braun.pdf).

## 1) Executive Summary (6–10 bullets)

- B. Braun is seeking a **unit forecast at the product-family and monthly level** to better plan needs for **shared components**.  
- Product-family/month forecasting is viewed as **more accurate than SKU-level** and expected to **create less “nervousness”** in their planning system.  
- SKU-level variability can be **partially addressed via safety stocks**, reinforcing the preference for higher-level forecasting.  
- There is strong interest in **interpreting supply-chain “signals” and trends**; B. Braun needs help making sense of the data.  
- This creates a potential **service/consulting component** opportunity focused on signal interpretation (specific scope/tools **unknown**).  
- A key operational challenge is the **rapid acceleration of product-mix changes**, making demand planning harder.  
- Core demand-planning uncertainties include: **when elevated demand will decline** and **where demand may spike next**.  
- Planning is constrained by the fact that **some raw materials have long lead times**.  
- Relationship value is noted in B. Braun’s connection with **Karen & Premier** for insights into hospital dynamics and broader industry themes.

---

## 2) Meeting Context

- Source notes are referenced as “**Supply Shortage Prediction Notes.docx**” and “**8/12/22 Call With B. Braun**.”  
- The document also shows “**Monday, December 5, 2022 8:45 AM**” — **date context is unclear/unknown** (it is not confirmed whether this reflects the actual meeting date, a file timestamp, or a separate event).  
- Discussion focused on forecasting approach, demand-planning uncertainties, and how to use/interpret supply-chain signals to improve planning under product-mix volatility and lead-time constraints.

---

## 3) Key Decisions / Confirmations

- Confirmed preference/need: **unit forecast at the product family + month level** (instead of SKU-level).  
- Rationale confirmed in the notes: this approach is considered **likely more accurate** and expected to **reduce system nervousness**, with SKU-level variation managed via **safety stocks**.

---

## 4) Open Questions / Follow-ups

- Demand trajectory questions:
  - **When will high demand fall off?**
  - **Where is demand about to spike?**
- Signal interpretation support:
  - What specific **data sources**, **methods**, or **tools** should be used to interpret supply-chain signals is **unknown**.
  - What the **service/consulting component** entails (deliverables, cadence, responsibilities) is **unknown**.
- Forecasting implementation details:
  - Which **product families** and which definition/hierarchy to use is **unknown**.
  - Whether the forecast needs to be **statistical, judgmental, or hybrid** is **unknown**.

---

## 5) Risks / Dependencies

- **Rapidly changing product mix** may reduce forecast stability and increase planning complexity.  
- **Long lead times for some raw materials** create dependency on earlier, more reliable signal detection and forecasting.  
- The value of supply-chain signal trends depends on the ability to **interpret the data correctly**; lack of clarity on approach/tools is a dependency.  
- Reliance on insights from **Karen & Premier** is a relationship dependency (specific mechanism and continuity **unknown**).

Subject: Next steps on product-family/month forecasting & supply signal interpretation

Hi [Name],  
Thank you again for the discussion. We understand B. Braun’s preference is for a **unit forecast at the product-family and monthly level** to support planning for **shared components**, with SKU-level variability managed via **safety stocks**.

As next steps, could we confirm:  
1) The **product-family hierarchy** you want to use (and which families to include first), and  
2) Which **supply-chain signals/data sources** you’re referencing today so we can propose an approach to **interpret trends** and highlight potential spikes or demand fall-off earlier.

Once we have that, we can outline a proposed forecasting output and a potential **signal-interpretation support** model (scope/cadence TBD).  
Best,  
[Your Name]

## 1) Executive Summary (6–10 bullets)

- Initial recommended focus is to **start with top-volume SKUs**.
- **Forecast accuracy is being undermined by mix changes** driven by **practice/physician preference** (e.g., a physician leaves a practice and the supplier is not notified).
- Current demand planning inputs include **historical data, standard SIOP, marketing “Market View” (18-month growth estimate), sales estimates, and seasonality**.
- Demand is **primarily distributor-driven and can be lumpy**; distributors are **blind to true Point of Sale (POS)** in the way retailers may have POS visibility (e.g., Walmart).
- Preferred planning outputs: **8–10 week forecast window** (8 weeks would help), **~5 weeks safety stock**, and **raw Excel output**; current forecasting is **monthly and split evenly across weeks**.
- Team confirmed a **deep-dive pilot**: focus on **regional anesthesia (epidurals)**, using the **same data Jennifer (Demand Planner) would receive**, and generate **weekly + monthly forecasts** at **SKU level** (and also for the overall group).
- An area of acute difficulty is **pain control / regional anesthesia** (Spine / Epidurals / Peripheral nerve block / Combined).
- Open questions include handling of a **large order sitting for 90 days** and understanding **duration of customer switching to alternatives**.
- Notes indicate **allocation/protection behavior** (“B. Braun tries to protect current customers by restricting / going on allocation”) and a supply disruption reference involving **Teleflex spilling over to B. Braun** (exact meaning unclear).

---

## 2) Meeting Context

Discussion centered on improving near-term forecasting and visibility for a distributor-driven demand environment. The team reviewed current planning inputs (SIOP, historical, marketing/sales views, seasonality), challenges caused by physician-driven mix shifts, and preferences for an actionable forecast horizon and format. The group aligned on running a targeted category pilot (regional anesthesia—epidurals) with outputs at both aggregated and SKU levels.

---

## 3) Key Decisions / Confirmations

- **Pilot approach confirmed:** Deep dive into **a single category (regional anesthesia—epidurals)**.
- **Data fidelity requirement:** The pilot should **show the data that Jennifer would actually receive**.
- **Forecasting granularity confirmed:**
  - Produce **monthly and weekly** forecasts.
  - Deliver outputs for the **whole group** and for **individual SKUs**.
- **SKU-level requirement:** “Need to have at SKU level if possible.”
- **Marketing focus confirmed:** “Focus on top volume SKUs initially.”

---

## 4) Open Questions / Follow-ups

- **Aged large order:** “Is this large order that has been sitting out there for 90 days still really needed? Has the hospital already received an alternate supply?”
- **Switching behavior:** When a hospital switches to an alternative (example mentioned: “if a BBraun alt?”), **how long do they stay with it before switching back**?
- **POS visibility:** Extent/availability of true **Point of Sale (POS) data** is **unknown**.
- **Supply disruption note clarity:** “Teleflex troubles spilled over to B. Braun, they current ramp up fast enough.” Meaning is **unclear** (needs confirmation).

---

## 5) Risks / Dependencies

- **Dependency:** Carmel (VP Sales) needs to provide the **full SKU list** to enable matching and forecasting.
- **Data limitation risk:** Distributor demand is **lumpy** and distributors are **blind to POS**, which may limit forecast accuracy and root-cause visibility.
- **Process risk:** Practice/physician-driven mix shifts can **rapidly invalidate historical patterns**, contributing to poor forecasts.
- **Operational risk:** If allocation/restriction is used to protect current customers, it may **distort demand signals** and complicate interpretation of order patterns.
- **Unknown supply disruption impacts:** The Teleflex/B. Braun note may imply constraints or volatility, but the **true impact is unknown** pending clarification.

---

## 6) Suggested Next-Step Email (short draft)

Subject: Next steps: Regional anesthesia (epidurals) forecasting deep dive + SKU list

Hi team,  
Per our discussion, we’ll start by focusing on top-volume SKUs and run a deep dive in **regional anesthesia (epidurals)**. We will use the same inputs Jennifer typically receives and produce forecasts at both **monthly and weekly** levels for the **overall group and individual SKUs** (SKU-level where possible), delivered in **raw Excel**.

**Action needed:** Carmel—can you please send the **list of all SKUs** so we can match and begin the category pilot?

Also, we’d like to confirm a couple of items:  
- The status/need for the **large order outstanding for ~90 days** (and whether the hospital sourced an alternative).  
- Any insight on **how long hospitals typically stay on an alternative** before switching back.  
- Whether any **POS data** is available (even partial).

Thanks,

## 1) Executive Summary (6–10 bullets)

- The discussion focused on expanding a **custom analytic service** for a client’s IV market analysis from an initial **IV fluids** focus to a **holistic view across IV therapy categories**.
- The client explicitly requested more emphasis on the **“triple play” (bag, tubing, catheter)**, noting that **fluids are least important** to them and “don’t make us any money.”
- The team aligned that the “triple play” analysis should effectively cover **five IV therapy categories** (infusion devices; infusion sets/accessories; needleless connectors; fluids & bag-based drugs; TPN macronutrients), with **safety IV catheters discussed as a potential sixth**.
- Proposed core deliverable: **blinded facility-level market share visualizations** using **three-digit ZIP codes** and **anonymized facility numbers** to show share/compliance patterns without naming facilities.
- A key use case is **sales enablement**: mapping compliance gaps geographically to help prioritize accounts, acknowledging that revealing facility identities requires permission and is **not scalable** across thousands of facilities.
- The team discussed how **Premier contracts** may include **spend-based and/or market-share-based compliance** requirements, often with **tiered pricing** tied to thresholds—an area suppliers are increasingly focused on.
- An additional opportunity area raised: **IV pump fleet age / replacement cycles** (pump life “typically defined as **10 years by AHA and FDA**”), using Premier-tracked purchases (past **seven years**) and supplier-reported sales for cross-validation.
- A **DEHP-free filter** was confirmed feasible: a **DEHP flag exists in the item master (PIM)** and is believed accurate for solutions and relevant to tubings (to be validated).
- Pricing and scope packaging were debated (initial proposal referenced **$250K**; internal view that six-category scope could be much higher), but **no final pricing decision** was recorded.
- Timeline intent: internal review Monday and send an updated proposal **before Thanksgiving**.

---

## 2) Meeting Context

- **Topic:** Expanding a custom analytic service for a client’s IV market analysis.
- **Shift in scope:** From IV fluids-only to a broader “triple play” / holistic IV therapy view.
- **Primary constraint:** Provide actionable facility-level insight while keeping identities blinded (scalable approach) and recognizing permission-based identification is possible but limited.

---

## 3) Key Decisions / Confirmations

- **Holistic category approach confirmed:** Proceed with analysis across **all five (or six)** IV therapy categories rather than a single-category (fluids-only) view.
- **Blinded facility-level method confirmed:** Use **3-digit ZIP + anonymized facility IDs** as the primary scalable facility-level visualization approach.
- **DEHP-free filter feasibility confirmed:** The **PIM DEHP flag exists** and can be used; a validation report from **PIM/Fusion** will confirm accuracy for solutions and tubings.
- **Proposal timing intent confirmed (proposed):** Internal review Monday; send revised proposal **before Thanksgiving**.

---

## 4) Open Questions / Follow-ups

- **Final scope:** Confirm whether the deliverable covers **five categories** or **five plus safety IV catheters (six)**. *(Unresolved in notes.)*
- **Pricing:** Determine final pricing and structure, given the client has already seen **$250K** and internal discussion suggested higher pricing for expanded scope. *(No final decision recorded.)*
- **Engagement structure:** Decide between a shorter-term/limited “chart/compliance view” across all categories vs. a broader full package. *(Options discussed; not finalized.)*
- **Facility identification:** Whether any portion should include named facilities via permission-based disclosure, and under what conditions. *(Scalability constraints noted; approach TBD.)*

---

## 5) Risks / Dependencies

- **Scope ambiguity (5 vs. 6 categories):** Risk of misalignment with client expectations until explicitly confirmed.
- **Pricing sensitivity:** Client has already seen **$250K**; raising price or changing packaging may create friction unless tied clearly to expanded value and deliverables.
- **Data/field validation dependency:** DEHP-free filtering depends on verifying the **PIM/Fusion** field accuracy for solutions and tubings.
- **Privacy/scalability constraint:** Named facility disclosure is possible with permission but **not scalable**; success of sales enablement use cases depends on acceptance of the blinded approach.
- **Pump fleet analysis limitations:** Premier can track purchases for the **past seven years** (not full 10-year life), so fleet-age estimates may be incomplete without careful framing.

Subject: Updated IV Therapy Analytics Proposal — Scope & Sample View

Hi [Client Name],  
Following our discussion, we’re updating the proposal to shift from a fluids-only view to a holistic IV therapy approach aligned to the “triple play” (bag/tubing/catheter), covering the relevant IV therapy categories.

We also plan to include blinded facility-level market share and compliance visualizations (3-digit ZIP + anonymized facility IDs) so your team can see geographic/compliance patterns at scale without revealing facility identities.

Two quick confirmations we’d like from you:
1) Should we include **safety IV catheters** as an additional category (i.e., five vs. six total categories)?  
2) Would you prefer a shorter-term compliance/visualization-focused package first, or the broader full analytics package from the start?

We’ll share an updated proposal (and a sample visualization) by **[date—unknown]** / before Thanksgiving as discussed.

Thanks,  
[Name]

## 1) Executive Summary (6–10 bullets)

- There is **strong initial interest**, particularly from **Carmel (VP Sales)**, but momentum slowed when **Jennifer (demand planner)** went out on leave; a follow-up opportunity remains.
- The group aligned on a **next-step deep dive in a single category**—**regional anesthesia (epidurals)**—to show outputs in the format **Jennifer would actually receive**.
- Planning and forecasting are challenged by **practice/physician-driven mix changes** (e.g., a physician leaves and the supplier isn’t notified), leading to poor forecasts.
- Demand is largely **distributor-driven and “lumpy,”** and the team is **blind to Point of Sale**, complicating near-term visibility.
- Preferred operating parameters: **8–10 week forecast window** (8 weeks would help) and **~5 weeks safety stock**.
- Current process produces a **monthly forecast**, which is then **evenly divided across weeks**; stakeholders want better near-term issue visibility to support **manual modifiers**, including competitor impacts.
- Outputs should be **SKU-level if possible**, and **raw Excel data** is the preferred format.
- Key validation questions remain around **order validity** (“large order…sitting out there for 90 days”) and **switching behavior** (how long hospitals stay on alternatives before switching back).
- A potential legal/permissions dependency was raised: **whether hospitals have granted rights to use the data** (status unknown).

---

## 2) Meeting Context

- Discussion focused on improving demand planning/forecasting with emphasis on:
  - Near-term forecasting needs (8–10 week window) and inventory posture (5 weeks safety stock).
  - The reality of **distributor-driven demand** and lack of **POS visibility**.
  - Operational pain points driven by **mix shifts from clinical practice changes and physician preference**.
- A specific current struggle area was called out: **regional anesthesia** (Spine, Epidurals, Peripheral nerve block, Combined), with agreement to focus the next step on **epidurals**.
- Planning inputs used by Jennifer (demand planner) were noted: **Standard SIOP process, historical sales, “Market View” (marketing’s growth estimate over 18 months), sales team estimates, and seasonality**.

---

## 3) Key Decisions / Confirmations

- Agreed next step: **Dive deeply into a single category (regional anesthesia – epidurals)** and **show the data/output that Jennifer would actually receive**.
- Agreed analytical approach (as captured): **match data, then forecast at month level for 3 months out**, and perform analysis for the **whole group** plus **individual SKU level if time allows**.
- Confirmed preference/requirement signals:
  - **SKU-level detail** “if possible”
  - **Excel raw data** as best output format
  - **8–10 week forecast window** as ideal (8 weeks would help)

---

## 4) Open Questions / Follow-ups

- Order validity: Is the **“large order that has been sitting out there for 90 days”** still needed, or has the hospital already received **alternate supply**?
- Switching behavior: When hospitals switch to an alternative, **how long do they stay** before switching back?
- Data rights: **Have hospitals granted rights to use this data?** (permission status **unknown**)
- Operational follow-up: Re-engage on planning progress given **Jennifer’s leave** caused momentum loss (timeline/availability **unknown**).

---

## 5) Risks / Dependencies

- **Data rights / permissions risk:** Unclear whether hospital data can be used (must be confirmed before scaling analysis).
- **Dependency on SKU list:** Analysis depends on **Carmel sending the list of all SKUs**.
- **Data limitations:** Distributor-driven demand is **lumpy** and the team is **blind to POS**, which may constrain forecast accuracy and lead-time visibility.
- **Forecast instability risk:** **Practice changes and physician preference** can shift mix unexpectedly; supplier may not be notified when physicians change/leave.
- **Operational constraints:** Mentioned that “Teleflex troubles spilled over to B. Braun,” and B. Braun protects customers via **allocation/restricting**; supply constraints could distort observed demand signals.

---

## 6) Suggested Next-Step Email (short draft)

Subject: Next step: Regional anesthesia (epidurals) deep dive + SKU list

Hi [Name/Carmel/Jennifer],  
Thanks again for the discussion. As agreed, our next step is to **dive deeply into regional anesthesia—starting with epidurals**—and **show the data/output in the format Jennifer would receive** (preferably **raw Excel**), at **SKU level if possible**.

To proceed, could you please:
1) **Send the list of all SKUs** (Carmel), and  
2) Confirm the status of **data rights/permissions** (have hospitals granted rights to use this data?), and  
3) Clarify whether the **large order open for ~90 days** is still needed or if alternate supply was received.

Once we have the SKU list, we’ll **match the data and build a 3-month monthly forecast**, and where time allows include **individual SKU-level analysis**.

Best,  
[Your Name]

## 1) Executive Summary (6–10 bullets)

- Meeting attendees spanned Marketing, Corporate Supply Planning, Contracting, Demand Planning, Channel Management, Sales Operations, and Sales (see full list below).
- A key theme was **end-to-end visibility into service levels**, especially what customers actually experience.
- The group highlighted a visibility gap: companies may see **their own service levels to distributors**, but often **cannot see distributor service levels to health systems**.
- Participants emphasized the value of being able to see **service level trends over time** (how things are trending).
- Ongoing supply constraints/shortages were referenced as a long-standing issue (“been dealing with shortages for 10 years”).
- Notes include two items with unclear context—**“Intracan - follow up”** and **“Pain control - market leader”**—requiring clarification.
- The document references a **“B. Braun Demo 5/15/23”** (timestamp noted as Monday, May 15, 2023 10:03 AM); outcome/decisions from that demo are **unknown** from this chunk.

---

## 2) Meeting Context

**Participants and roles:**
- Peter McGregor — Marketing  
- John Gibbons — Corporate supply planning; manages supply planning (SOP); works with plants  
- Bill Miller — Contracting; manages Premier relationship  
- Jennifer Jordan — Demand planning  
- Len Bridgeman — Channel management team; “been dealing with shortages for 10 years”; works cross functionally  
- Jeremy How — Sales Operations; provides visibility into the post-manufacturing supply chain; works with HIRC on SRS to identify disruptions to supply chain  
- Carmel Veron — Sales  

**Stated themes / “What resonated”:**
- “We can see the service levels our customer's experience, which is the most important.”
- “They can see their service levels to their distributors, but they can't see the distributor's service levels to their health systems.”
- “We can see how things are trending.”

**Referenced item:**
- “B. Braun Demo 5/15/23” (Monday, May 15, 2023 10:03 AM)

---

## 3) Key Decisions / Confirmations

- **No explicit decisions or formal confirmations captured** in the provided chunk summary (unknown).

---

## 4) Open Questions / Follow-ups

- What is **“Intracan”**, and what specifically is required for the **follow-up**? (owner unknown)
- What does **“Pain control - market leader”** refer to (product, segment, company, or positioning), and what is the intended takeaway/action?
- What was the purpose and outcome of the **B. Braun demo (5/15/23)**? Any decisions, next steps, or stakeholder feedback are **unknown** from this chunk.

---

## 5) Risks / Dependencies

- **Visibility dependency:** Achieving end-to-end service-level insight appears to depend on access to data beyond the manufacturer’s direct view—specifically, **distributor-to-health-system service levels** (potential data sharing and integration risk).
- **Operational risk:** Persistent supply disruptions/shortages (“been dealing with shortages for 10 years”) may continue to impact service levels and planning effectiveness.
- **Information gaps:** “Intracan” and “Pain control - market leader” lack context; unresolved ambiguity may block progress or misalign priorities.

---

## 6) Suggested Next-Step Email (short draft)

Subject: Follow-ups: service-level visibility themes + open items (Intracan / Pain control)

Hi team,  
Thanks for the discussion. I captured a few follow-ups to confirm:

1) **Intracan** — what is the specific follow-up needed, and who owns it?  
2) **Pain control – “market leader”** — can someone confirm what this refers to and the intended takeaway/action?  
3) **Service-level visibility** — we aligned on the importance of seeing customer-experienced service levels and trends; can we confirm what data is available today vs. what’s missing (especially distributor → health system service levels)?

Also, the notes reference a **B. Braun demo on 5/15/23**—please share any outcomes/decisions and agreed next steps from that session.

Thank you,

## 1) Executive Summary (6–10 bullets)

- B. Braun hosted the **“BBraun Market Insights Meeting in CLT”** on **11/3/2025 at 1:00 PM** (CLT-BET-340) to discuss **Market Insights (Supply Chain tech data)** and how to make insights more actionable.  
- The team was **highly receptive**, with strongest engagement from **Bill Miller, Anita Zado, and Tracy Butryn**, especially around **compliance analytics** and **services support**.  
- Two dominant priorities were reiterated throughout: **(1) Compliance (especially in IV)** and **(2) Patient safety**.  
- B. Braun expressed strong interest in a **“Live view”** to work proactively through a **current disruption**, plus broader **shortage radar** capabilities (drops/spikes, switching behavior, competitor recovery).  
- Proposed MI use cases spanned: **IV Solutions national compliance + forecasting**, **Safety IV Catheters conversion monitoring**, **Regional Anesthesia (NRFit) adoption mapping**, **distributor/channel SLA visibility**, **program performance (leakage/dual-award risk/clawbacks)**, and **ESG/safety benchmarking (PVC/DEHP-free, closed-system)**.  
- Delivery expectation: **family-level defaults**, **SKU drilldowns for exceptions**, **monthly refresh with alerting**, and outputs usable in **Excel + dashboards for QBRs**.  
- Data context: B. Braun currently uses **IQVIA data delivered in Power BI**, and it is **hard to obtain hospital data directly**; a **member-permission** approach (“Lindsay’s form”) and/or modeled **“expected spend”** were discussed to infer compliance.  
- Commercial confirmation: **Bill confirmed purchase of ~\$150K** for **two Performance Group (PG) data contracts** (**one data-only; one data + services**).  
- Scope confirmation: **IV/IV-therapy is a National-only agreement**, and B. Braun wants **compliance visibility across National accounts**; timing/reporting should align to **calendar fiscal year (new FY begins January)**.

---

## 2) Meeting Context

- **Meeting name:** “BBraun Market Insights Meeting in CLT”  
- **Date/time:** **11/3/2025, 1:00 PM**  
- **Location:** **CLT-BET-340** (address noted as **13520 Ballantyne Corporate Pl**); **Teams option** was provided  
- **Purpose:** Discuss Market Insights capabilities and support for **supply chain / market analytics**, with emphasis on turning insights into **actionable compliance and disruption responses**  
- **Engagement:** Most engaged participants: **Bill Miller, Anita Zado, Tracy Butryn**; overall tone: **highly receptive**  

---

## 3) Key Decisions / Confirmations

- **Purchase confirmed:** Bill confirmed paying **~\$150K** for **two PG data contracts** (**one data-only; one data + services**).  
- **Priority alignment:** Compliance confirmed as **#1 priority** across **Bill/Anita/Tracy**, especially for **IV**.  
- **Agreement scope confirmed:** **IV/IV-therapy is National-only**, and B. Braun wants **National compliance visibility**.  
- **Cadence/timing confirmed:** Reporting should align to **calendar fiscal year**, with the new FY starting **January**.

---

## 4) Open Questions / Follow-ups

- **Outcomes linkage feasibility:** Can MI **“link compliance to clinical outcomes”** (e.g., compare **DEHP-free converted vs. non-converted** facilities/regions)? **Approach unknown.**  
- **Marketing evidence request:** Can MI show **“outcome or practice benefits for highly compliant IV-solutions portfolios”** to support marketing content? **Unknown.**  
- **Compliance gap drivers:** Bill requested the **“why” behind compliance gaps** (reasons hospitals buy on/off contract). **Taxonomy/method unknown.**  
- **National compliance modeling:** Details/accuracy of modeled **“expected spend” by hospital/IDN** to infer compliance. **Unknown.**  
- **Non-acute segmentation:** Best way to analyze **“OLM vs. independent split in non-acute”** and compare growth rates. **Definitions/data approach unknown.**  
- **Stakeholder expansion:** Which additional stakeholders (e.g., sales/marketing content owners) should be included and when. **Unknown.**  
- **NRFit pilot target:** Pilot metric includes **“+X pp NRFit penetration”**; **X is unknown**.

---

## 5) Risks / Dependencies

- **Hospital-level visibility dependency:** Since it’s **hard to obtain hospital data directly**, deeper compliance views may depend on **member-permission enablement** (“Lindsay’s form”) and/or acceptance of **modeled expected spend** approaches.  
- **Modeling/attribution risk:** Requests to tie **compliance → outcomes** and/or support **marketing claims** may be constrained by data availability and methodological limits (**feasibility unknown from notes**).  
- **Operational dependency on “Live view”:** The near-term disruption use case assumes ability to stand up timely **real-time/near-real-time monitoring** (exact data feeds/cadence not specified in notes).  
- **Timeline alignment:** Deliverables should fit a **January FY start**; timing risk if scoping/SOW is delayed.

---

## 6) Suggested Next-Step Email (short draft)

Subject: Next steps from BBraun Market Insights meeting (11/3) — compliance + disruption “live view”

Hi team,  
Thanks again for the discussion on 11/3. We captured that **compliance (especially IV)** and **patient safety** are the top priorities, and that a **“live view”** to work proactively through the current disruption would be immediately valuable.

Proposed next steps:
1) Share a **proposal for PG (including services) across all PG categories**.  
2) Draft a **SOW for the National (IV) compliance effort**, including how we’ll **triangulate gaps** and **measure typical volume by hospital type**.  
3) Confirm the preferred path for hospital-level visibility: **member-permission (“Lindsay’s form”)** vs. **modeled expected spend** (or both).  
4) Identify additional stakeholders to include (sales/marketing content owners); noting **Phil’s** openness to an in-person executive session in **Allentown, PA**.

If helpful, we can use the **current disruption** as the working example to define what the “live view” should include (alerts, dashboards, and Excel-ready outputs).  

Best,

## 1) Executive Summary (6–10 bullets)

- Premier walked B. Braun through the **Premier Market Insights** platform (Teams meeting: **12/3/2025, 9:00 AM**) and how it can support **contract compliance**, **market segmentation**, **supply resiliency/demand forecasting**, **market sizing**, and **market expansion**.
- Premier confirmed the dataset is **not limited to Premier-contracted SKUs**; it is intended to reflect what facilities purchase through their **ERP** “across all vendors,” including **capital and pharmaceutical** (as available in the underlying sources).
- Premier described its data foundation as a hospital/provider “source of truth,” aggregating from **hospital ERPs**, **GPO members and non-members**, **pharmacy wholesalers**, and **distributor invoices**, with a push toward **daily data submission** (historically monthly).
- A key proposal is to expand B. Braun’s **contract compliance analytics** coverage from **two to four contract categories** (examples cited: **regional anesthesia trays** and **safety IV catheters**) with support from Premier’s contract success/integration team and a stated **90-day launch plan**.
- Premier also proposed a **six-month custom analytics engagement** focused on **IV fluids**, including **blinded facility-level** (and **three-digit ZIP**) share insights, plus disruption and resiliency analysis (e.g., Hurricane Helene impacts).
- Integration options were confirmed: access via Premier’s application, exports (e.g., email), and/or **monthly feeds** into B. Braun tooling (e.g., **Databricks/Power BI**) with **secure, role-based access** and entity-code mapping.
- Key limitation clarified: Premier can show purchasing by **facility** and often **department**, but **cannot see actual “usage” location**—only what a department purchased (with an optional concept to map EHR charge/log data to purchasing data).
- Pricing in the dataset is generally **PO/receipt-line price** and explicitly **excludes rebates** (“No rebate”).
- Several follow-ups were agreed, including delivering **sample compliance exports**, an **IV transaction data model sample**, and an **offline session** on pharma market sizing/pricing validation and outpatient vs. acute conservation trends.

---

## 2) Meeting Context

- **Meeting title:** “Bbraun/Premier Market Insights -virtual”  
- **Date/Time:** **12/3/2025 9:00 AM**  
- **Platform:** Microsoft Teams  
- **Purpose:** Premier presented Market Insights capabilities and discussed potential expansion of B. Braun’s compliance analytics (from 2 to 4 contract categories) plus a proposed six-month custom analytics engagement focused on IV fluids, including supply disruption/resiliency insights.

---

## 3) Key Decisions / Confirmations

- **Dataset scope:** Not limited to Premier-contract items; intended to be comprehensive for what facilities purchase through ERP **across all vendors**, including **capital and pharmaceutical** (as confirmed in Q&A).
- **Care setting coverage:** Non-acute/outpatient is included when purchases flow through an acute-owned entity’s ERP; Premier also supplements non-acute via distributor/other sources (specific completeness by segment = **unknown**).
- **Membership vs national views:** Premier can show views for **Premier membership** and a **non-Premier/non-GPO dataset** described as statistically significant enough to extrapolate nationally; Premier indicated they will show both in the application.
- **Integration:** Premier confirmed they can provide **monthly data feeds** into a client data mart and map Premier entity codes to client security; B. Braun preference stated to centralize in **Databricks/Power BI**.
- **Granularity & limitation:** Purchasing can drill down to **SKU level** and **department purchase attribution**, but Premier **cannot see point-of-use/clinical usage**, only purchasing by department.
- **Pricing basis:** Pricing is PO/receipt-derived and **does not include rebates**.
- **IV fluids engagement concept:** Premier can provide **blinded** facility-level insights (names only with permission) and **three-digit ZIP** share, plus disruption analysis using receipt data and (for a sub-sample) inventory signals.

---

## 4) Open Questions / Follow-ups

- **Commercials:** Pricing/investment breakdown for expanding subscription (2 → 4 contracts) and for the IV custom engagement is **pending/unknown** (Premier to provide).
- **Facility-level permissions:** Operational process, boundaries, and timelines for obtaining **named facility-level** data by category/contract type remain **unclear** (Premier to clarify permission workflow).
- **Outpatient vs acute conservation:** Whether non-acute/outpatient shows similar conservation/inventory patterns as acute is **unknown**; Premier to investigate and report back.
- **IV fluids demand recovery:** Whether conservation protocols represent permanent changes and expected rebound level/timeline is **not fully answered**; some near-term inventory “bleed” timing discussed, but long-term persistence remains open.
- **Market sizing + in-market pricing validation (pharma):** Ellen requested an offline discussion; specific products and desired outputs are **unknown** from these notes.
- **Post–six-month plan:** What ongoing model means “after six months” and whether to pursue a longer-term partnership (and potential better terms) is **open**.
- **Client-side owner:** Who “takes point” on B. Braun’s side for evaluating a full IV transaction data model sample is **unknown**.

---

## 5) Risks / Dependencies

- **Permission dependency:** Access to **named facility-level** detail may require member permissions in some scenarios; this could constrain deliverables and timelines until the process is clarified and executed.
- **Rebate exclusion:** Because pricing is PO/receipt-based with **no rebate**, any net-price analyses may require additional client-side inputs or adjustments (approach not defined here).
- **Usage vs purchase mismatch:** Premier’s data reflects **purchasing**, not true **clinical usage**; deeper “usage” analytics would depend on additional integration (e.g., mapping EHR charge master/log data).
- **Disruption-driven noise:** IV fluids purchasing/spend may be distorted by disrupted ordering (e.g., orders placed but not received); analyses depend on using receipt/availability signals and may vary by facility/data completeness.
- **Data cadence transition:** Premier’s move toward **daily submissions** (from monthly) suggests a transition period; exact timing/coverage of daily discovery is **unknown**.

---

## 6) Suggested Next-Step Email (short draft)

Subject: Follow-ups from 12/3 Premier Market Insights discussion

Hi Lindsay/Matt,  
Thank you for the walkthrough of Premier Market Insights on 12/3. To keep momentum, can you please share the following:

1) A **sample compliance data export** for the **four recommended contract categories** (including what we receive today) for Jeremy and team to review for integration planning.  
2) A **sample transaction data model** for **one IV category** to scope the proposed **six-month IV fluids custom analytics** effort.  
3) A **breakdown of current vs. proposed investments/pricing** for the subscription expansion and the IV engagement.  
4) The **process and timing** for obtaining **facility-level naming permissions** (by category/contract type).  

Separately, we’d like to schedule:  
- An **offline session** on **pharma market sizing and in-market price validation** (specific products TBD), and  
- A brief follow-up on **non-acute/outpatient vs acute conservation/inventory trends** once you’ve had a chance to review.

Please propose a few times for a follow-up session (you mentioned a deeper-dive deck).  
Best,

## 1) Executive Summary (6–10 bullets)

- A Premier “Market Insights” demo with B. Braun’s marketing-focused group was held virtually on **1/9/2026 at 1:00 PM (Teams)**, explicitly shifting focus away from contract compliance and into market intelligence/insights use cases.
- Premier described Market Insights data as primarily sourced from **hospital ERP transactions** (POs, invoices, inventory levels), with **pharmaceutical wholesaler tracings** used to complete the pharmacy purchasing picture (noting the standard app is **not yet** showing wholesale data).
- Core capabilities discussed: hospital-level segmentation/targeting, cross-sell/leakage analysis, portfolio gap analysis (including “expected to reality”), taxonomy mapping/crosswalks, competitive intelligence, and delivery via **dashboards vs data feeds**.
- Data presentation is designed to preserve **facility blinding** (hospital rows shown, but IDN hierarchy intentionally not displayed); limited geography (e.g., **state / 3-digit ZIP**) may be used without revealing identities.
- Premier asserted broad visibility into purchasing when captured in ERP—i.e., **“everything these hospitals are buying, not just what is on contract”**—and emphasized **SKU-level** granularity tied to Premier’s item master (including drugs).
- Pricing analytics are available with confidentiality guardrails: **no facility-level pricing**; pricing can be rolled up (e.g., manufacturer/class of trade) and/or by geography (e.g., 3-digit ZIP).
- A “triple play” cross-sell framework for B. Braun’s IV ecosystem was discussed; B. Braun noted the commercial framing is more outpatient-focused, but the framework could apply broadly.
- The team requested transparency/validation aids (e.g., **data dictionary/attribute list** and an **Excel sample cut**) and proposed validating CAPS/compounding/nutrition-related representation via a **client-provided SKU list**.
- The pre-built app was positioned as a **lightweight way to start** but is currently **acute ERP-focused** and missing pharmaceutical wholesale data; Premier expects wholesale to be added in **~3–4 months**.
- Next step is an internal B. Braun debrief to select the highest-value use case and decide the preferred engagement model (app vs custom dashboards vs data feeds), followed by a tailored follow-up demo.

---

## 2) Meeting Context

- **Meeting title:** “Confirmed-BBraun MI Demo -virtual”  
- **Date/time:** **1/9/2026 1:00 PM**  
- **Platform:** Microsoft Teams  
- **Attendees/purpose (as stated):** B. Braun regrouped with a **smaller, marketing-focused group** to go deeper on Premier **Market Insights / market intelligence** after a prior session emphasized contract compliance.
- **Framing:** B. Braun currently extracts data into **Power BI**, but showed interest in starting with **Premier dashboards** while requesting access to underlying attributes/samples to validate what drives outputs.

---

## 3) Key Decisions / Confirmations

- **Scope for this call:** Contract compliance was **de-emphasized/skipped** in favor of market insights/market intelligence.
- **Purchasing coverage (ERP-based):** Premier stated they can see **“everything these hospitals are buying, not just what is on contract”** when it flows through the ERP.
- **ERP + wholesale for pharmacy completeness:** Premier described combining ERP data with **pharmaceutical wholesaler tracings** to produce a more comprehensive view; however, the **standard app** shown is currently **acute ERP-focused** and **does not yet include wholesale data**.
- **Blinding approach:** The view is at **individual hospital** level; **IDN hierarchy exists** but is intentionally not displayed to preserve blinding.
- **Tableau enhancements:** Adding filters/sorting (e.g., sort by market share/volume) is feasible and described as a small configuration effort.
- **Pricing constraints:** Premier confirmed **no facility-level pricing** will be provided; only rolled-up and/or geographic rollups (e.g., **3-digit ZIP**) due to confidentiality/contract constraints.
- **Taxonomy mapping:** Premier confirmed they can map B. Braun taxonomy to Premier taxonomy and cross-reference competitor items so competitive products can be analyzed within the client taxonomy.

---

## 4) Open Questions / Follow-ups

- **Data source scope:** Whether Premier accesses **pharmacy management systems** in addition to ERP (response given: **“Not to my knowledge”**).
- **Category definition detail:** What exactly is included in categories like **“infusion sets and accessories”**; Premier said they could pull up/clarify the contents.
- **Workflow capability confirmation:** Whether users can filter to hospitals above a given share threshold in one category (e.g., **≥70% fluids**) and then evaluate gaps in another category (answer in provided summaries: **unknown**).
- **Engagement model decision:** Whether B. Braun wants to start with **dashboards only** vs also pursue a **data stream/data feed** (still undecided).
- **Primary use case selection:** Which category/use case should anchor the next iteration (examples raised: injectables, infusion, safety IV catheters; premix categorization was unclear in the moment).
- **CAPS/compounding/nutrition representation:** Confirmation that key products/competitors (e.g., **Fragran Sterl Service** and **QUVA**, as mentioned) and substitutes are represented—pending SKU validation/sample cut.
- **Taxonomy acceptance:** Whether **Premier taxonomy is acceptable** for the intended analyses (explicitly open).
- **Best-value path:** Which internal use case is the “best use case that has the most value” to pursue first (explicitly open).

---

## 5) Risks / Dependencies

- **Dependency on wholesale data timing:** The standard app is **missing pharmaceutical wholesale data** today; Premier expects to roll it in within **~3–4 months** (timing risk if pharmacy completeness is critical immediately).
- **Validation dependency (SKU list):** Ability to confirm CAPS/compounding/nutrition coverage and produce a representative sample cut depends on B. Braun providing **SKU names/part numbers (and optionally volume)**.
- **Taxonomy dependency:** Portfolio gap and cross-sell analyses depend on agreement that **Premier taxonomy (and/or mapped taxonomy)** is acceptable.
- **Confidentiality guardrails:** Facility-level pricing and certain facility-identifying constructs (e.g., IDN rollups) are constrained; analysis designs must work within these limits.
- **Decision dependency:** Progress depends on B. Braun aligning internally on whether to prioritize **app vs custom dashboards vs data feeds**, and selecting a first use case to demo/scope.

## 6) Suggested Next-Step Email (short draft)

Subject: Next steps: Premier Market Insights — use case selection + SKU list for sample cut

Hi Matt/Audrey,  
Thank you for the Market Insights walkthrough on 1/9. Internally we’re going to debrief over the next few days and align on the highest-value initial use case (app vs custom dashboards and whether we also want to explore a data feed).

In parallel, we’ll send a SKU list (name + part number; volume if available) for the CAPS/compounding/nutrition-related items so you can confirm representation and provide an Excel sample cut and the attribute list/data dictionary we discussed.

Once we’ve aligned on the use case, we’d like to schedule a follow-up demo focused on that scenario and any key category-definition questions (e.g., what’s included in “infusion sets and accessories”).

Best,

## 1) Executive Summary (6–10 bullets)

- Premier Inc. provided a **Jan 2026 “Market Insights / Data & Analytics”** overview of **Premier Market Insights (PMI)** for the **U.S. acute care market**, positioning PMI as a data + analytics capability for commercial, procurement, and supply chain use cases.  
- PMI is described as leveraging **PO, invoice, inventory, cross-reference, and master data** delivered via a **customized dashboard** with **daily data updates**.  
- The deck outlines a proposed **Premier / B. Braun Market Insights Partnership**: continue current compliance subscriptions, add expanded compliance subscriptions, and execute a **6-category IV custom analytics engagement (6 months; $250,000)**, with optional add-ons (selection **unknown**).  
- Current state appears to include existing compliance subscriptions for **Regional Anesthesia Trays and Supplies (SP-OR-2538)** and **Safety IV Catheters (AD-NS-2112)**.  
- Contract performance recommendations emphasize **Safety IV Catheter** monitoring (AscenDrive highlighted due to an incumbent dual-awarded supplier leaving the market) and note complexity in **Regional Anesthesia Trays** (custom tray exclusions).  
- The deck discourages prioritization of **Laparoscopic Surgical Instruments** and **Instrument Container** opportunities (“don’t recommend,” discretionary/limited opportunity; “N/A”/complex spend).  
- Example market performance metrics (Premier-only acute care view) cited: **B. Braun revenue $299M (+18.5% YoY)** vs **market $1.7B (+13.6% YoY)**; **market share 17.6% (up from 16.8%)**.  
- Supply/shortage and disruption examples include: **higher past-due PO line rates vs competition**, lower backorders/cancellations vs competitors late 2024, and a note that **Baxter products are projected to have the highest shortage risk** (per PMI projections).  
- Targeting concepts include a **“50 ‘Whale’ accounts”** action list and capital refresh segmentation (**PRIME TARGET / NURTURE / LOCKED**) plus optional **DEHP/PVC-free** targeting messaging (what will be used is **unknown**).  
- **Approval/commitment status is not stated** in the provided summary (i.e., the proposal is “recommended” but not explicitly confirmed as agreed).

---

## 2) Meeting Context

- This document is a **Premier Inc. PMI (Market Insights / Data & Analytics) deck** dated **Jan 2026** focused on the **U.S. acute care market**.  
- It describes PMI’s **data assets** (PO/invoice/inventory/cross-reference/master data), **delivery mechanism** (custom dashboards), and **daily refresh cadence**, alongside example analytics and use cases.  
- It frames a **partnership proposal with B. Braun** centered on compliance monitoring and IV-category analytics, plus optional add-ons.  
- Specific meeting date/attendees and whether this was a live meeting vs. a proposal leave-behind are **unknown**.

---

## 3) Key Decisions / Confirmations

- **Currently in place (appears confirmed as “Currently Subscribe”):**
  - **Regional Anesthesia Trays and Supplies (SP-OR-2538)** – currently subscribed  
  - **Safety IV Catheters (AD-NS-2112)** – currently subscribed
- **Supplier overview noted (status appears descriptive, not a decision):**
  - “Current Contract Awards **29 active contracts**… **4 SURPASS** and **4 AscenDrive**”
  - “Currently Purchases **2 MSA Offering**” (data only / data + support)
- **Not confirmed in the text (recommended but not explicitly approved):**
  - Expansion via new subscriptions: **Regional Anesthesia Trays and Supplies (AD-OR-2538)** and **Safety IV Catheters (SP-NS-1627)**  
  - **6-category IV custom analytics engagement** (**$250,000; 6 months**)  
  - Optional add-ons (e.g., **capital refresh recency**, **DEHP/PVC-free targeting**) — selection **unknown**

---

## 4) Open Questions / Follow-ups

- Are B. Braun and Premier **approving** the proposed expansion items and the **$250,000 / 6-month** custom analytics engagement? (**Unknown**)  
- What is the **final scope and deliverable list** for **“IV Categories (6) – Custom analytics services”** beyond the examples shown? (**Unknown**)  
- Which **optional add-ons** (Capital Refresh Recency; DEHP/PVC-Free Targets) are desired and in what timeline? (**Unknown**)  
- The deck references **“Potential Next Steps”** (page 29 header mentioned), but the specific steps are **not provided** in the summary—what are they? (**Unknown**)  
- For contract performance priorities: confirm whether B. Braun wants to prioritize **Safety IV Catheter / AscenDrive** monitoring given the cited dual-award supplier change and associated risk.

---

## 5) Risks / Dependencies

- **Contract performance / share risk:** The deck flags that an **alternate supplier activated 10/1 as the new dual awarded supplier**, which **could put current volume at risk** due to a new option being available.  
- **Category data complexity:** **Regional Anesthesia Trays** performance analysis is described as complicated due to **exclusion of custom trays**, which may limit straightforward comparisons and require careful interpretation.  
- **Supply chain performance perception:** PMI examples indicate **B. Braun past-due PO line rates** are consistently higher than competition (even while backorders/cancellations were lower), which could affect stakeholder confidence unless addressed/monitored.  
- **Dependency on data + enablement:** Proposed outcomes (e.g., “Target Action List,” Zip-3 sales deployment, “50 Whale accounts”) depend on timely data delivery, alignment on targeting criteria, and adoption by sales/commercial teams (owners not specified).  
- **Unconfirmed scope/investment:** The expanded subscriptions and $250K engagement are described as “new investment,” but approval status and timing are **unknown**, creating planning dependency.

## 1) Executive Summary (6–10 bullets)

- Document proposes a **“generalized, privacy-safe approach”** for IV-therapy manufacturers to **measure and monitor Premier contract compliance** across Premier membership.
- Compliance is measured **monthly** by **category and site/department**, explicitly **honoring exact contract/tier language** and aligning to manufacturer taxonomy (**families/SKUs**).
- **Leakage** is defined as **“off-contract competitor volume inside the tier scope.”**
- Approach uses **triangulated data inputs**: provider ERP, med-surg distributor tracings, pharmaceutical wholesaler tracings, and manufacturer on-contract tracings.
- Default governance is **“Name-blind by default”** using **stable, de-identified facility/department IDs** plus aggregated geography, with suppression **“where N<2.”**
- Reporting is designed for **“No pricing exposure”**: units and **optional standardized dollars (fixed weights)** are reported, **never contract prices** (methodology for standardized dollars is **unknown**).
- Framework is organized into **Five Pillars**, spanning name-blind observability, expected-volume modeling, permissioned named compliance, early-warning signals, and non-acute intelligence.
- Named (facility-level) visibility is available only via **explicit member permission**: **member signs Premier’s national permission form → specific facilities can be flipped to named** (process/timing details are **unknown**).
- Outputs include **dashboards + CSV/Excel**, **Anonymous Target Cards**, and **alerts**, with a **monthly refresh** and **quarterly roll-ups**.

---

## 2) Meeting Context

- The document outlines a compliance measurement and monitoring method intended for **IV-therapy manufacturers** operating within **Premier membership**.
- Emphasis is on a **privacy-safe, name-blind** default model that still supports actionable targeting (e.g., by region/cohort, facility type, department) and can be upgraded to **named account packs** when permission is granted.
- The approach supports both **acute** and **non-acute** contexts (Premier-centric for non-acute), and can be **extended beyond IV therapy**.

---

## 3) Key Decisions / Confirmations

- Compliance measurement will **“honor exact contract/tier language”** and can align to manufacturer taxonomy (**families/SKUs**).
- Default operating mode is **“Name-blind”**, using **stable de-identified facility and department IDs**, with geography aggregated and **suppressed where N<2**.
- Reporting will maintain **“No pricing exposure”**: **units** and **optional standardized dollars (fixed weights)** only; **no contract prices**.
- **Named visibility requires explicit member permission**, via **Premier’s national permission form**, after which selected facilities can be **flipped to named**.

---

## 4) Open Questions / Follow-ups

- **Permissioning process:** Implementation details and timelines for the **“permission form (National)”** process are **unknown**.
- **Cohort definitions:** How “system cohort” and “geo cohort” leaderboards are defined beyond listed geographies (ZIP3/county/CBSA) is **unknown**.
- **Standardized dollars:** The methodology for **“optional standardized dollars (fixed weights)”** is **unknown**.
- **Appendix contents/results:** The “appendix” referenced (including “Example Presentation to Baxter”) and any results shown are **unknown**.

---

## 5) Risks / Dependencies

- **Data dependencies:** Success depends on continued access/quality of **provider ERP, distributor tracings, wholesaler tracings, and manufacturer on-contract tracings** (specific data-sharing constraints are **not described**).
- **Permission dependency for named insights:** Moving from name-blind insights to named account management depends on **member opt-in** (permission form), which may limit coverage and speed.
- **Governance constraints:** Privacy rules (e.g., **suppression where N<2**) may reduce visibility in smaller cohorts/geographies.
- **Model dependency:** The “expected-volume modeling for any U.S. facility” is a key enabler; details on inputs/validation (beyond mention of 100-Top Hospitals Program attributes) are **not provided**.
- **No pricing exposure constraint:** While protective, omitting contract prices may limit certain ROI narratives, relying instead on units and standardized dollars (method is **unknown**).

---

## 6) Suggested Next-Step Email (short draft)

Subject: Next steps: privacy-safe Premier compliance monitoring approach (IV therapy)

Hi [Name],  
Thanks for reviewing the proposed privacy-safe approach to measuring Premier contract compliance.

To align on execution, could we confirm the following:
- The exact **contract/tier scope language** and the manufacturer taxonomy mapping (**families/SKUs**) to be used for monthly measurement.
- Data availability for the **triangulated inputs** (provider ERP, distributor/wholesaler tracings, and manufacturer on-contract tracings).
- How we’ll define and operationalize **cohorts/leaderboards** (e.g., system cohort vs. geo cohort).
- The methodology and intended use for **standardized dollars (fixed weights)**.
- The process/timing for the **Premier national permission form** to enable named visibility at select member facilities.

If helpful, we can also outline a first-pass workflow for “Map & size → Explain → Act → Protect” and identify initial target cohorts for anonymous targeting and alerts.

Best,

Subject: Confirming rescheduled MI prep meeting + items to align on

Hi team,  
Per Anita’s note, the “Prep for Market Insights Pitch to B. Braun” meeting has been moved back by one week—can someone please confirm the updated date/time?

For the session, we still need to finalize the key areas to highlight in the MI pitch. Also, can we clarify what “Surpass” and “AscenDrive” refer to in the contract snapshot context?

Thanks,

## 1) Executive Summary (6–10 bullets)

- B. Braun (Jennifer Gotto) reset expectations: B. Braun is **“not in a position to move toward a large-scale investment or full engagement”** of Premier’s Custom Analytics Services at this time.
- Near-term path (if any) must be **“a very limited, tightly scoped exploratory project (focused on a single category at the facility level)”** rather than a broad engagement.
- The purpose of a small pilot would be to **compare Premier’s dataset vs. B. Braun’s existing data** to determine whether incremental insights justify deeper engagement.
- Premier (Matthew Bossemeyer) requested direction on an engagement approach and offered a more detailed proposal; he suggested focusing Custom Analytics Services on the **“6 Category IV Ecosystem.”**
- Premier’s proposed data approach is to **combine “hospital ERP + Rx wholesaler data”** to create a more complete category spend picture.
- Previously discussed use cases remain on the table conceptually, but B. Braun confirmed they are **not pursuing the full set of use cases now** (e.g., leakage/compliance targeting and portfolio gap analysis) as part of the immediate effort.
- A key dependency to start validation is B. Braun providing a **CAPS SKU list**; Premier will then produce a sample cut and data dictionary for coverage validation.
- Pharmacy admixture representativeness is explicitly important to validate (Jake’s input to be captured).

## 2) Meeting Context

- Participants referenced: **Jennifer Gotto (B. Braun)**, **Matthew Bossemeyer (Premier)**, and **Jake (B. Braun)** (for pharmacy admixture representativeness feedback).
- Context: Follow-up after internal discussions at B. Braun to recalibrate scope and investment expectations for Premier Custom Analytics Services.
- Current posture: Exploration only—B. Braun needs time to assess value, understand complementarity with existing data sources, and build a longer-term business case (Jennifer noted she is **“still getting grounded in my role”**).

## 3) Key Decisions / Confirmations

- B. Braun confirmed that any near-term engagement must be **strictly exploratory and narrow**: **single category**, **facility-level**, and **not** a broad Custom Analytics Services engagement.
- Confirmed limitation: **“At this time, we would only explore a narrow, category-specific proof-of-concept and not the full set of use cases discussed last week.”**

## 4) Open Questions / Follow-ups

- **Pilot scope:** Which **single category** will the tightly scoped exploratory project focus on? *(Unknown)*
- **Inputs / timing:** When will B. Braun deliver the **CAPS SKU list** to enable Premier’s sample cut and validation? *(Unknown timeline)*
- **Optional add-ons:** Does B. Braun want to include **“Capital Refresh”** and/or **“DEHP/PVC-Free”** add-ons? (Jennifer indicated they are **not ready** to decide yet; Premier asked for a decision.)
- **Alignment call:** Will both parties hold a **30-minute sync next week** to align on the minimal pilot scope? *(Not confirmed)*

## 5) Risks / Dependencies

- **Dependency:** Pilot validation depends on B. Braun supplying the **CAPS SKU list**; without it, Premier cannot produce the sample cut for coverage validation.
- **Scope risk:** Misalignment on “minimal viable” pilot scope (single category, facility-level) could delay progress if not confirmed quickly.
- **Value realization risk:** Pilot may show limited incremental insight versus B. Braun’s current data sources, which would reduce the case for deeper engagement.
- **Data representativeness risk:** Pharmacy admixture coverage/representativeness must be validated; missing or skewed representation could undermine conclusions (Jake’s review noted as a priority).
- **Decision timing risk:** Unclear timing for decisions on optional add-ons (Capital Refresh, DEHP/PVC-Free) could create proposal churn.

## 6) Suggested Next-Step Email (short draft)

Subject: Next steps: narrow exploratory pilot scope + CAPS SKU list for sample validation

Hi Jennifer (and team),

Thank you for the update and for resetting expectations. We understand B. Braun is **not in a position to move toward a large-scale investment/full engagement** right now, and that any near-term work would need to be **a very limited, tightly scoped exploratory project (single category, facility-level)**.

To move forward with the exploratory validation:
1) Can you share the **CAPS SKU list** (or confirm when you expect to have it)? Once received, we’ll **produce the sample quickly** and include a **data dictionary** to validate coverage across **ERP + Rx wholesaler data**.  
2) Can we confirm the **single category** you’d like to focus on for the proof-of-concept?  
3) Are you open to a **30-minute sync next week** to align on the minimal pilot scope and success criteria (including capturing **Jake’s feedback on pharmacy admixture representativeness**)?

Separately, we can hold on **Capital Refresh** and **DEHP/PVC-Free** until you’re ready to decide.

Best,

## 1) Executive Summary (6–10 bullets)

- Team is preparing a **“Market Insights” pitch deck for B. Braun**, using a shared file: **“Market Insights - B Braun - Nov 2025.pptx”**.
- **Sachin Shah** will **reuse the deck presented to JnJ last week** as the starting point, and then **revise/update it for B. Braun** (noting it still referenced JnJ at the time).
- Contributors were asked to **add their sections directly into the shared deck**.
- The **Performance Groups (PG) team will own their slide section**; others should **coordinate with TiYany/PG before adding PG content**.
- **Audrey Siepiela** reviewed PG slides and **did not add more**, stating B. Braun has **“a few somewhat active users”** and additional screenshots beyond the existing **conversion explorer** slide did not seem necessary.
- **Tiffany (TiYany) Hughes** requested an **ETA for the deck framework** to enable timely insertion/review of her **contract performance slides** before the **Monday meeting** (ETA not provided in the available summary).
- The meeting invite included a **contract snapshot** for B. Braun: **29 active contracts; 4 SP and 4 AD; purchases 2 MSA offering**, plus example contract lines ($40k and $135k) (details below).
- Outstanding: whether **TiYany and Matt** believe anything is missing from the PG content is **unknown** based on the provided chunk.

---

## 2) Meeting Context

- **Format/source:** Email thread + meeting invite.
- **Purpose:** Prepare and finalize a **Market Insights pitch deck** tailored for **B. Braun**.
- **Working approach:** Start from a previously delivered **JnJ deck**, then edit/replace content to match B. Braun.
- **Timing:** References a **Monday meeting** (date/time **unknown** in the provided chunk).
- **Collaboration model:** Team members contribute sections directly in the shared PPT, with PG content managed/controlled by the PG team.

---

## 3) Key Decisions / Confirmations

- **Deck foundation confirmed:** Reuse the **JnJ deck from last week** as the baseline for B. Braun (owner: **Sachin Shah**).
- **Content ownership confirmed:** **PG team owns the PG slide section**; others should not add PG items without coordinating with **TiYany/PG**.
- **PG slide scope confirmed (for now):** **No additional PG screenshots** needed beyond existing content (per **Audrey Siepiela**, citing limited user activity).

---

## 4) Open Questions / Follow-ups

- **ETA needed:** When will the **deck framework** be ready for others—specifically to enable **TiYany** to add and get review time on **contract performance slides** before Monday? (**Unknown**)
- **PG completeness check:** Do **TiYany and Matt** think anything is missing from the PG section after Audrey’s review? (**Outcome unknown**)
- **Matt’s prep:** Matt said “I’m prepping this morning” — what deliverable/section this refers to is **unknown**.

---

## 5) Risks / Dependencies

- **Dependency on deck framework timing:** TiYany’s ability to insert and circulate **contract performance slides** depends on the **framework being available** with enough lead time before Monday.
- **Risk of stale references:** Starting from a deck that still referenced **JnJ** creates risk of **missed client-specific updates** if revisions aren’t completed thoroughly.
- **Coordination risk for PG content:** Since PG content is “owned” by PG, uncoordinated edits could create **version conflicts** or rework.

---

## 6) Suggested Next-Step Email (short draft)

Subject: B. Braun Market Insights Deck — framework ETA + section owners

Hi team,  
Quick check-in on the **“Market Insights - B Braun - Nov 2025.pptx”** deck.

- **Sachin**: can you share the **ETA for the updated deck framework** (JnJ → B. Braun revisions) so everyone can start dropping in final content?  
- Reminder: **PG team owns the PG section**—please **tag/reach out to TiYany** before adding PG-related updates.  
- **TiYany**: once the framework is ready, please add the **contract performance slides** so we have time for review ahead of **Monday**.

Thanks,  
[Your Name]
