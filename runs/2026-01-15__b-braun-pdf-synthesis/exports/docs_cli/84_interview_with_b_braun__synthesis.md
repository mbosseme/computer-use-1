## 1) Executive Summary (6–10 bullets)

- Marketing (Pete) requested the team **“focus on top volume SKUs initially.”**
- Demand planning (Jennifer) relies on **historical data**, a **“Standard SIOP process,”** a marketing **Market View** (growth potential over **“18 months”**), and **sales team estimates**, with **seasonality** adjustments.
- A core challenge is that **most demand comes from distributors**, which can be **“lumpy,”** and the team is **“blind to the ‘Point of Sale’”** signal.
- Preferred planning horizon is an **8–10 week forecast window** (noting **“Forecast window of 8 weeks would help”** and **“8-10 week forecast window is ideal”**); typical **safety stock is “5 weeks.”**
- Current forecast is built **monthly** and then **“divided evenly across weeks,”** and the preferred output format is **“raw data in excel.”**
- The team is **currently struggling in pain control (regional anesthesia)** across **Spine, Epidurals, Peripheral nerve blocks, Combined**.
- Sales noted disruption dynamics: **“Teleflex troubles spilled over to B. Braun”** and B. Braun protects customers by **“restricting / going on allocation.”**
- The group agreed to **deep-dive a single category first—regional anesthesia (epidurals)**—and to **show the data Jennifer would actually receive**, with forecasting at **month and week level** and **group + individual SKU** views.
- A key near-term need is visibility into **where problems will occur soon**, to support manual forecast modifiers (including competitor impacts).

## 2) Meeting Context

This discussion focused on improving demand planning and forecasting inputs/outputs, particularly under conditions of distributor-driven ordering (lumpy demand and limited POS visibility) and shifting clinical/product mix driven by practice changes and physician preference (including scenarios where a physician leaves and the **“supplier is not notified”**). The team aligned on piloting an approach in a high-priority problem area: **regional anesthesia (starting with epidurals)**, with a strong emphasis on SKU-level forecasting and practical, Excel-based outputs aligned to Jennifer’s current planning workflow.

---

## 3) Key Decisions / Confirmations

- **Pilot scope confirmed:** **“Dive deeply into a single category (regional anesthia – epidurals)”** as the initial focus area.
- **Data realism confirmed:** The pilot should **“show the data that Jennifer would actually receive.”**
- **Forecast output requirements confirmed:**
  - Forecasts at **month and week level**
  - Views for the **whole group** and for **each individual SKU**
- **Granularity preference reiterated:** Forecasting **“at SKU level if possible.”**
- **Initial prioritization confirmed:** **“Focus on top volume SKUs initially.”**

## 4) Open Questions / Follow-ups

- **Outstanding order validity:** For a **“large order… sitting out there for 90 days,”** is it still real demand, or has the hospital already found alternate supply? *(Alan)*
- **Switch-back dynamics:** If a hospital switches to an alternative (e.g., **“if a BBraun alt?”**), **how long will they stay** before switching back? *(Alan)*
- **Unclear statement to clarify:** Sales comment that they **“current ramp up fast enough”** (exact meaning/intent **unknown** due to unclear wording).

---

## 5) Risks / Dependencies

- **Product mix volatility risk:** Practice changes and physician preference can quickly shift mix and cause **poor forecasts**, especially if the supplier is not notified of physician/practice changes.
- **Signal quality dependency:** Distributor-driven demand is **lumpy** and the team is **blind to POS**, increasing forecast error and limiting early detection of true consumption changes.
- **Operational dependency on forecast horizon:** Planning effectiveness depends on achieving an **8–10 week window** while managing around **5 weeks of safety stock**.
- **Supply/market disruption risk:** Spillover effects from competitor issues (e.g., **Teleflex** disruptions) and allocation behaviors (**“restricting / going on allocation”**) may distort ordering patterns and complicate demand interpretation.
- **Data readiness dependency:** The pilot depends on receiving and matching a complete **SKU list** and successfully building month/week forecasts at both **group** and **individual SKU** levels.

## 6) Suggested Next-Step Email (short draft)

Subject: Next Steps: Epidurals Deep Dive + SKU List for Month/Week Forecast Build

Hi team,  
As agreed, we’ll start by diving deeply into **regional anesthesia (epidurals)** and will structure the output to reflect **the same data Jennifer would actually receive**, delivered as **raw Excel data**.

To proceed, please send the following:
- **Carmel:** the **full list of SKUs** (including identifiers needed to match to available data)

Once received, we will:
- Match SKUs/data and build a forecast at **month and week level**
- Provide views for the **overall group** and **each individual SKU** (starting with top-volume SKUs)

Open items we’ll need to resolve during the build:
- Whether the **90-day outstanding large order** is still valid demand or has been replaced by alternate supply  
- Typical **switch-back timing** when a hospital moves to an alternative supplier/product

Thanks,  
[Your Name]
