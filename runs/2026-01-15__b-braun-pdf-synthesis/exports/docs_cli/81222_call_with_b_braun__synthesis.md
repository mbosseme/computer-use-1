## 1) Executive Summary (6–10 bullets)

- B. Braun needs **“a unit forecast at the product family and month level”** to better plan for **shared components** across products.  
- Product-family/month-level forecasting is viewed as **“likely more accurate than SKU level”** and **“will create less nervousness in B. Braun’s system,”** with SKU-level variability addressed via **safety stocks**.  
- Monitoring **supply-chain signals** is considered valuable (“Seeing the trends in the supply chain signals… is very helpful”), but B. Braun **needs help interpreting the data**.  
- There may be an opportunity to pair the solution with a **service/consulting component** focused on interpreting signals and forecasting.  
- A major operational challenge is **“keeping up with changes in product mix, which have greatly accelerated.”**  
- The team raised core demand uncertainty questions: **when high demand will fall off** and **where demand is about to spike**.  
- Planning is constrained by **long lead times** for some raw materials.  
- The relationship with **Karen & Premier** is seen as highly valuable for **hospital insights and industry themes**.

---

## 2) Meeting Context

The discussion focused on B. Braun’s forecasting and supply planning needs—specifically improving forecast granularity (product family/month) to support shared-component planning, using supply-chain signals more effectively, and addressing heightened volatility from rapid product mix shifts and uncertain demand.

---

## 3) Key Decisions / Confirmations

- **Confirmed preference/position (not a formal decision):** Product family/month-level forecasting is considered preferable to SKU-level forecasting because it is **“likely more accurate”** and reduces system “nervousness,” with SKU variability handled via safety stock.  
- **No explicit decisions recorded** (unknown).

---

## 4) Open Questions / Follow-ups

- **Demand outlook:** “When will high demand will fall off?” (unknown)  
- **Demand spike detection:** “Where is demand about to spike?” (unknown)  
- **Follow-up needed (owner unknown):** Define scope, cadence, and format for delivering the **product family/month unit forecast**.  
- **Follow-up needed (owner unknown):** Clarify what supply-chain signals are being monitored today and where interpretation support is most needed.

---

## 5) Risks / Dependencies

- **Volatile product mix:** “keeping up with changes in product mix, which have greatly accelerated” could reduce forecast stability and planning effectiveness.  
- **Lead-time constraints:** “Some raw materials have long lead times,” increasing the cost of forecast error and requiring earlier commitments.  
- **Interpretation dependency:** Value from supply-chain signal monitoring depends on the ability to **interpret** the data correctly (support need identified; approach/ownership unknown).  
- **External insight dependency:** Continued value relies on insights from **Karen & Premier** regarding hospital dynamics and industry themes (availability and process unknown).

## 6) Suggested Next-Step Email (short draft)

Subject: Next steps on product-family/month forecasting & signal interpretation support

Hi [Name],  
Thank you for the discussion. Based on what we captured, B. Braun’s key need is **a unit forecast at the product family and month level** to support shared-component planning—since it’s viewed as **more accurate than SKU-level** and should create **less nervousness** in the planning system (with SKU variation covered via safety stock).

You also noted that supply-chain signal trends are helpful, but the team **needs help interpreting the data**, and that rapid product-mix shifts and long raw-material lead times add risk.

Could we confirm:
1) The product families and time horizon to include in the monthly unit forecast, and the desired delivery format/cadence  
2) Which supply-chain signals you’re monitoring today and the specific interpretation questions you’d like addressed (e.g., demand falling off vs. upcoming spikes)

Happy to set up a working session to align on scope and deliverables.  
Best,  
[Your Name]
