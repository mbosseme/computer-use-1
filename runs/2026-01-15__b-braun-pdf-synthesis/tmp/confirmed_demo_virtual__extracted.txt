Hi Matt,Thank you for the follow-up and for the time spent with us last Friday. I’ve been working through internalconversations since then, and given where we are today, I want to reset expectations a bit on ourimmediate path forward.At this stage, we are not in a position to move toward a large-scale investment or full engagement of theCustom Analytics Services outlined. As I am still getting grounded in my role, we need more time to assessthe potential value, how it complements data sources we already have access to, and what the longer-termbusiness case could look like.With that in mind, if we proceed in the near term, it would need to be a very limited, tightly scopedexploratory project (focused on a single category at the facility level) so we can evaluate the usefulness ofthe data, understand the gaps it fills, and confirm alignment with internal priorities before consideringanything broader.A small pilot like this would also help us compare your dataset against the information we already receiveand determine whether the incremental insights justify a deeper engagement later on.A few points based on your questions:Initial Use Cases: At this time, we would only explore a narrow, category-specific proof-of-conceptand not the full set of use cases discussed last week.CAPS SKU List: We are still gathering the requested information. Once we have it, we can share itso that the sample cut can be produced for validation.Next Meeting: We’re not ready to scope multiple use cases or consider add-ons (Capital Refresh,DEHP/PVC-Free) yet. If helpful, we can schedule a short call next week to align on what a verysmall initial pilot could look like, but it would be strictly exploratory.Thanks again for your partnership and understanding as we work through this internally. Please feel free tosend over any materials that might help us better evaluate a minimal pilot approach prior to our next

I’m checking in as you complete your internaldebrief to see where you’re leaning on an engagement approach so we can move toward amore detailed proposal.Based on our conversation, it sounds like the strongest near-term ﬁt for the marketing groupis the Custom Analytics Services focused on the 6 Category IV Ecosystem. Our aim wouldbe to combine hospital ERP + Rx wholesaler data into a complete picture of a hospital’sspend across these categories. We discussed two primary use cases on Friday:\. Targeting leakage / cross-selling / compliance gaps: Driving near-term revenue byprioritizing your most committed facilities (high IV Fluid share) to see where they areleaking adjacent categories.a. Portfolio Gap Analysis: Identifying where B. Braun is missing participating items thatcompetitors have momentum in, helping ensure longer-term growth.Regarding our next steps, I have noted a few speciﬁc follow-ups:Initial Engagement: What are the top use cases your team would like to scope indetail?CAPS SKU List (Claire/Jake): Do you have any update on the SKU list for theCAPS/compounding sample data cut? Once we have that, we can produce the samplequickly to validate our coverage across the ERP and Rx wholesaler data. Jake’sfeedback on seeing the pharmacy admixture representativeness is a priority for this
3 of 4validation phase, and we’ll include a data dictionary with the sample.Would you be open to a 30-minute sync next week to ﬁnalize initial use cases, includingwhether you would like us to include the Capital Refresh or DEHP/PVC-Free add-ons fromthe initial proposal?Slides from Friday attached for ease of reference.Best,Matt BossemeyerVice President – Advanced Analytics & Supply Chain TechnologyOhice: 704-816-5028Matthew_Bossemeyer@premierinc.com  |  Premier, Inc.From: Anita_Mouroutsos@PremierInc.comWhen: 1:00 PM - 2:30 PM January 9, 2026Subject: Conﬁrmed-BBraun MI Demo - virtualLocation: Microsoft Teams Meeting________________________________________________________________________________Microsoft Teams Need help?Join the meeting nowMeeting ID: 248 563 994 931 48Passcode: GE3hP2eNDial in by phone+1 980-729-7847,,134379721# United States, Charlotte(833) 445-2017,,134379721# United States (Toll-free)Find a local numberPhone conference ID: 134 379 721#For organizers: Meeting options | Reset dial-in PINOrg help________________________________________________________________________________
