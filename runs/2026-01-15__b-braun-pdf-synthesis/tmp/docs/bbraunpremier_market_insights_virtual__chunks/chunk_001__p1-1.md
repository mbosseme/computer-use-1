## Chunk 1 (pages 1-1)

## Key points
- Meeting: **“Bbraun/Premier Market Insights -virtual”** (Microsoft Teams), **12/3/2025 9:00 AM**.
- Premier presented an overview of its **Market Insights** data/analytics platform and how it can support:
  - **Contract compliance** monitoring and improvement
  - **Market segmentation and targeting** (share, growth, competitor positioning beyond contracted products)
  - **Supply chain resiliency and demand forecasting**
  - **Market expansion and market sizing**
- Data foundation described as hospital/provider “source of truth”:
  - Aggregates data from **hospital ERPs**, **GPO members**, **non-GPO members**, **pharmacy wholesalers**, and **distributor invoices**.
  - Premier emphasized data quality because health systems “**are using it for their own accurate analysis… and therefore constantly grooming with us**.”
  - Premier is “**moving everybody to… daily data submission**” (historically monthly).
- Contract compliance expansion concept:
  - Proposal to expand B. Braun compliance analytics coverage from **two to four contract categories**, including **regional anesthesia trays** and **safety IV catheters**, with enhanced services from Premier’s contract success/integration team.
- Custom IV fluids analytics concept:
  - Premier proposed a **six-month custom analytics engagement** focused on IV fluids with **blinded** granular share insights (zip/facility level), plus supply disruption analysis (e.g., Hurricane Helene impacts).
- Data access and confidentiality:
  - Facility-level data access depends on **member permission** in certain scenarios (details vary by category/contract type).

## Decisions / confirmations
- Data scope is **not limited to Premier-contracted SKUs**:
  - Premier confirmed the dataset is “**comprehensive for everything that they purchase through their ERP… all vendors**,” including **“capital and pharmaceutical”** purchases (confirmed in Q&A).
- Coverage includes non-acute/outpatient when purchases flow through ERP and via supplemental sources:
  - If owned by an acute care entity and routed through ERP: “**absolutely**” included; Premier also supplements with distributor/other sources for non-acute data.
- Premier claims the ability to provide both:
  - Views within **Premier membership** and a **non-Premier/non-GPO** dataset “**statistically significant enough to extrapolate… nationwide**,” and will “**be very clear in the application to show you both**.”
- Delivery/integration options confirmed:
  - Data can be accessed via application, email exports, and integration into B. Braun tools (e.g., **Databricks** / **Power BI**) with “**secure, role-based access**.”
- For IV fluids analytics, Premier stated it can provide:
  - “**market share data… down to the three-digit zip code and uniquely identified (but blinded) facility level**” (facility names only with explicit permission).

## Open questions
- Pricing/investment details for subscription expansion:
  - Premier agreed to provide a breakdown, but the exact numbers are **unknown** in this chunk.
- Facility-level naming/permission boundaries across categories:
  - High-level rules were discussed; specific operational details and timelines are **unknown** here (action item exists to clarify process).
- Outpatient conservation vs acute care trends:
  - Need follow-up analysis; current findings are **unknown** in this chunk.
- Market sizing/pricing validation for specific pharma products:
  - Ellen requested this; specifics (products, outputs) are **unknown** here.

- **Schedule an offline discussion** to address “sizing of specific pharma product markets” and “confirming in-market pricing” using Premier data. *(Owners: Lindsay Schmidt, Ellen Menard)*
- **Review and share findings** on “conservation and inventory trends in non-acute/outpatient settings compared to acute care.” *(Owner: Matt Bossemeyer)*
- **Collaborate to connect data insights to economic/health outcomes** and member value (standardization, sustainability, financial impact presentations). *(Owners: Lindsay Schmidt, Aime Lenz)*
- **Clarify and communicate the process for obtaining facility-level data access** via member permission forms. *(Owner: Matt Bossemeyer)*
