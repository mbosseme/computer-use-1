## Chunk 2 (pages 1-1)

## Key points
- Current view is a “30,000 foot view” dashboard that “drills all the way down.”
- **Contract compliance data availability**
  - Today: B. Braun “currently get data on two contracts.”
  - Recommendation: “expand to four” contracts; on the two today “you get that data down to the facility department… Each competitive SKU… how it’s trending… each month… who they’re buying it from… how that’s affecting their compliance.”
- **Data sharing / integration**
  - Premier can “pass the updated data monthly” into a partner’s “data mart,” and can “tie basically our entity codes to your low level security.”
  - B. Braun prefers integrating into their existing tooling (“data bricks… feed it into Power BI”) to avoid sending reps “in 80 different directions.”
- **Department vs. usage**
  - Data is broken down “by department,” but Premier “can’t see where it’s used. We can just see if it’s purchased for a specific department.”
  - Follow-up option mentioned: map EHR “charge master and or log data” to ERP purchasing data to “tie it to what that department bought at a SKU level.”
- **Market/segmentation dashboards**
  - Dashboard columns described: total spend prior 12 months, last 12 months, growth, market share (prior vs last 12 months).
  - View shown is “limited to premiere only” with optional “extrapolation… overall US view.”
  - Ability to drill down “four levels below… to the skew level.”
- **IV fluids disruption context**
  - Hurricane Helene (October) created purchase order distortion: “inflated view of spent because a lot of those orders… weren’t delivered or received.”
  - Premier can use “actual receipt data” and also look at “issues out of stock” and (for a sub-sample) inventory data.
- **Geography + pricing**
  - Market share can be shown at “state level” and “zoom it down… to a three digit zip level… at a county level.”
  - Pricing example is “blinded” ASP trends; price comes “generally right off the purchase order or receipt… predominantly… the purchase order… price on the PO line” (explicitly “No rebate”).
- **Supply resiliency / backorder analytics**
  - Standard views: “past due lines… average lead time per product… back order.”
  - A “back order prediction tool” uses a “shortage condition score” to flag higher-risk products (example mentions Baxter highlighted).
- **Proposed engagement direction**
  - Expand compliance analytics subscription to 4 contracts; services support focused on “regional anesthesia trays.”
  - For IV: propose “six months on really a custom analytics deal” (not just standard feeds/app), using “both our ERP and RX pharmacy wholesaler data” for a “comprehensive view.”

## Decisions / confirmations
- Confirmed capability: Premier “can absolutely” set up data sharing/integration (e.g., monthly feeds to data mart; mapping entity codes to partner security).
- Confirmed limitation: can standardize and show purchasing by facility and (often) department, but “we can’t see where it’s used.”
- Confirmed pricing definition: PO/receipt-based price; “No rebate.”

## Open questions
- Whether SKU usage can be seen “in all the care areas” (answered partially: purchase-by-department, not true usage).
- Forecasting demand recovery for IV fluids:
  - Whether conservation protocol changes are “permanent changes… to protocol” and “will we expect it to come back, and at what level?” (no definitive answer given).
  - “when the bleeding is going to stop” for inventory drawdown (answered: “within the next month or so,” but longer-term conservation persistence remains a question).
- Outpatient/non-acute trends: question asked whether inventory/conservation patterns are similar; response: “I don't remember seeing the same degree of conservation in non acute… let me dig… add some comments…”
- Clarification requested on data rows (example vs actual B. Braun data) when a participant noted an implausible “0% share on the sets”; response: that row view was “just… articulative,” with a note they have another slide using B. Braun manufacturer.

## Action items (with owners if present)
- **Premier/Speaker 10**: “Let's get you a sample Jeremy of… the ones you subscribe to today… let's at least get that in your hands” (sample export).
- **Premier (Matt Bossemeyer)**: Follow up on non-acute/outpatient conservation comparison (“let me dig… add some comments at the end”).
- **Premier team**: Offer/propose “a separate session” with deeper dive (“we've got about 30 slides… happy to do a follow up”); user side indicated interest (“Yes, we would be interested”).
- **Premier/Speaker 10**: Proposal elements to review with client: expand to 4 contracts; work with “Tiffany and team… on regional anesthesia trays”; subscribe to safety IV catheters data (ASCEND/drive and add surpass); start a 6‑month custom IV analytics effort.

## Notable metrics/claims (exact phrases where possible)
- Current vs recommended contract coverage: “currently get data on two contracts… recommending that you expand to four.”
- Market sizing heuristic: “approaching $300 million on a 12 month revenue cycle, just within premium… multiply that by four… you’re playing in about a $1.7 billion market…”
- Fluids share change (Premier acute channel, adjusted for disruption): “your share is up about three points in this fluids category… within the premier channel.”
- B. Braun self-reported vs Premier estimate: “we grew about six points over over the prior year” (Speaker 9).
- Utilization/conservation shift: “structural shift in encounter level utilization of fluid about 10 percentage points reduction from a 12 month pre healing baseline.”
- Inventory change: “went from 10-15 days of inventory to 35 days of inventory.”
- Inventory bleed timing: “inventory bleed is almost done… wrap up within the next month or so… Lvps… where the bleed remains”
- Suppression expectations: “probably trending back towards five, maybe 6% from 812” (conservation persistence discussion).
- Baxter vs non-Baxter cohort utilization drop: “28% drop in utilization, versus 14%”
- Inventory drawdown impact on purchasing: “suppressed purchasing in q2 by 8% and in q3 of 25, by 5%”
- National volume decline cited by participant: “about 110 million units of IV fluids… declined… Becker's report… about encourage 12% down, about 112” (verbatim unclear; exact phrasing included as stated).
- Point-of-care/warehouse inventory baseline: “15 to 20 days… historically… closer to 15.”
