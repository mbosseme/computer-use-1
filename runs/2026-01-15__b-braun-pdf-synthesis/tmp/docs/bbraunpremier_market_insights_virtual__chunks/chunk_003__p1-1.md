## Chunk 3 (pages 1-1)

## Key points
- Premier can **append a customer’s own taxonomy** (e.g., “your own P and L structures and cost center structures”) into the data model so the customer can view data in their own categorization model (vs. “the premiere” categorization).
- A use case discussed: using Premier data to **size markets** for products with incomplete third-party visibility (example given where IQVIA misses a large share shipped direct/on manufacturer trucks).
- Premier confirms they can support **granular market expansion analysis**, including identifying portfolio gaps and overlaying a **demand forecasting model** with “a regional view.”
- Additional manufacturer interest areas mentioned: evaluating **products to acquire or self-manufacture** and identifying “partner opportunities” for “inorganic activities.”
- Premier notes long investment in supply chain analytics and data normalization: “15 years building out an item matching, vendor matching, Contract matching categorization model.”
- Two extra analytical “lenses” were mentioned (not included in the proposal presented): capital refresh recency and DHPWs conversion flagging.

## Decisions / confirmations
- Premier: “**Yeah, 100% agree**” that they can jump into market expansion / gap and forecasting work; “**Yes, I think we can absolutely jump into that.**”
- Premier confirms capability to flag DHPWs: “**we’ve built that flag into our item master, so we can certainly flag SKUs**.”

## Open questions
- Whether the customer wants Premier to provide **market sizing** using Premier data (e.g., “size 25% extrapolate nationally”) for specific pharma products (specific products not listed; unknown).
- “**What does that look like after six months?**” regarding refresh/ongoing relevance after an initial six‑month engagement.
- Whether the parties should pursue a **long-term partnership vs. six-month deal**, and whether there are “**terms… like, a better deal**” for longer-term commitment.
- Who would “**take point on your side**” if moving forward with a full transaction data model sample for an IV category (owner unknown).

## Action items (with owners if present)
- **Send slides (including proposal slide)** — Owner: Speaker 10 (“I’ve documented… to get you these slides.”)
- **Provide a sample of the compliance data to the group** (noting Jeremy in particular) — Owner: Speaker 10 (“We’ll get you a sample of the compliance data.”)
- **Provide a full sample of the transaction data model for one IV category (if customer wants)** — Owner: Speaker 10 (“we could certainly do a full sample…”); Customer owner to be determined (unknown).
- **Take offline discussion on specific pharma products for market sizing and in‑market pricing confirmation** — Owner: Speaker 8 (request); counterpart owner not specified (unknown).

## Notable metrics/claims (exact phrases where possible)
- Market visibility gap example: “**50 to 70%… shipped on their trucks, which doesn’t get captured by the iqvia data**.”
- Proposed approach: “**use your data just to size 25% extrapolate nationally**” (as described by Speaker 8).
- Data/analytics investment claim: “**15 years building out an item matching, vendor matching. Contract matching categorization model**.”
- Capital refresh recency concept: show whether capital purchased “**three to five years ago… recent… old**.”
- Engagement framing: “**six month deal**” intended “**to identify a longer term strategy**” (e.g., “embedding data in your data marts or adding on views”).
