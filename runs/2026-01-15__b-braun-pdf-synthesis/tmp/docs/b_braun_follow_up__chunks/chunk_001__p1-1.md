## Chunk 1 (pages 1-1)

## Key points
- Meeting topic: expanding a **custom analytic service** for a client’s IV market analysis, shifting from an initial **IV fluids** focus to a broader view across IV therapy categories.
- Client feedback: the client “**wanted more emphasis on the 'triple play'—bag, tubing, and catheter**” because “**fluids are the thing we care about the least**” and “**they don't make us any money**.”
- “Triple play” scope clarification: Amy stated it “**actually encompasses all five IV therapy categories**”:
  - infusion devices
  - infusion sets and accessories
  - needleless connectors
  - fluids and bag-based drugs
  - TPN macronutrients  
  plus “**safety IV catheters as a sixth category**” (holistic approach discussed as “five (or six)”).
- Deliverable idea: provide **blinded facility-level market share visualization** across categories using “**three-digit zip codes and anonymized facility numbers**.”
- Compliance/market share: Premier contracts may have both **spend-based** and **market share-based compliance requirements**, with **tiered pricing** tied to thresholds; suppliers are increasingly attentive.
- Sales enablement: visualize compliance gaps geographically to help sales prioritize accounts (without explicit facility names).
- Limits of naming facilities: obtaining member permission to reveal identities is possible in select cases but “**not scalable for thousands of facilities**.”
- IV pump fleet opportunity: pump age and replacement cycles affect targeting and capital acquisition timing.
  - Pump life “**typically defined as 10 years by AHA and FDA**.”
  - Premier can track pump purchases for “**the past seven years**” to estimate fleet age.
  - Pump sales are “generally reported by suppliers to Premier,” allowing cross-validation.
- DEHP-free filter request: confirmed feasible; “**the DEHP flag exists in the item master (PIM)**” and is “**accurate for the solutions and…relevant to the tubings**.”
- Pricing discussion: initial proposal referenced **$250K**; team debated higher pricing for six categories and possible pilot approach, but client had already rejected single-category framing.

## Decisions / confirmations
- Agreed direction: analyze IV therapy categories **holistically** rather than one category alone (“**all five (or six)**” categories).
- Confirmed approach: provide **anonymized/blinded facility-level insights** (3-digit ZIP + blinded facility IDs) as the primary scalable method.
- Confirmed feasibility: include a **DEHP-free product filter** using the PIM DEHP flag; validate via reporting from PIM/Fusion.
- Confirmed timeline intent (proposed): internal review Monday; send updated proposal **before Thanksgiving**.

## Open questions
- Final scope: whether deliverable covers **five vs. six** categories (discussion includes both).
- Pricing: whether to raise above the “**250**” already shown; what final price/structure will be accepted (various ideas discussed, no final agreement recorded).
- Engagement structure: whether to start with a limited “chart”/compliance view across all six for a shorter term vs. a broader full package (multiple suggestions, no final decision).

## Action items
- **Matt**: Provide “**a sample view or screenshot of the blinded facility-level market share analysis**” across relevant IV categories (noted “using Ron as the selector”).
- **Lindsay**: “**Pull a report from PIM and Fusion to validate the accuracy of the DEHP flag field for solutions and tubings**.”
- **Lindsay**: **Update the proposal**, consider pricing adjustments, and **schedule a final review** before sending the revised proposal to the client prior to Thanksgiving.
- **Matt**: Provide a **sample screenshot** for inclusion in the proposal (requested directly in transcript: “**Can you…give me a screenshot of that?**” / “**I'll see about that**.”).

## Notable metrics/claims (exact phrases where possible)
- “**Pump life typically defined as 10 years by AHA and FDA**.”
- “**Premier's data can track pump purchases over the past seven years**.”
- Initial price reference: “**They've already seen the 250.**” (context: $250K).
- Pricing claim: “**it's gonna be north of 1,000,000 bucks for six categories**.”
- Market concentration/value claim: “**there's only three players in this space that matter**” and “**there will be 10s of millions of dollars of volume they gain**” (if used appropriately).
- Scalability constraint: revealing facility identities “**is not scalable for thousands of facilities**.”
