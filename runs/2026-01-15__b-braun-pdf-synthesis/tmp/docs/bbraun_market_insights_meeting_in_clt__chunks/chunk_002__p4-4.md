## Chunk 2 (pages 4-4)

## Key points
- Meeting: **“BBraun Market Insights Meeting in CLT”** on **11/3/2025, 1:00 PM** at **CLT-BET-340 (16); 13520 Ballantyne Corporate Pl** (Teams option provided).
- Primary themes from discussion:
  - **“Compliance is key focus, esp. in IV.”**
  - **“Patient safety is the other key focus.”**
- Proposed Market Insights (MI) value areas for B. Braun:
  - **Shortage radar**: early detection of disruption patterns (drops/spikes by SKU, switching, competitor recovery) to reallocate inventory and communicate proactively.
  - **IV Solutions (National lens)**: **“8–10-week, family-level unit forecasts (Excel-ready)”**, anomaly alerts, and **“recoupling” tracking** for rebound timing.
  - **Safety IV Catheters**: geo heatmaps (3-digit ZIP/county), conversion targeting lists, and monitoring for reversion/dual-brand leakage.
  - **Regional Anesthesia**: **“NRFit adoption map”** and procedure-to-kit penetration to identify underuse; pair with clinical education for ERAS/opioid-sparing growth.
  - **Channel & distributors**: SLA visibility via fill-rate/partial-fill/lead-time/substitution flags and an escalation playbook.
  - **Program performance**: **“compliance & leakage watchlists”**, dual-award risk callouts, and clawback targets.
  - **ESG & safety**: benchmarking **PVC/DEHP-free** and closed-system adoption; package evidence for value-analysis narratives.
- Near-term value areas called out:
  - **Compliance opportunity** as **“biggest immediate lever”** (within Performance Groups and National scale, especially IV Solutions).
  - Interest in **supply-disruption analytics** (e.g., hurricanes) and a **“Live view”**.
  - Non-acute segmentation: **“OLM vs. independent split in non-acute.”**
  - Distributor/channel competitive visibility.
- Data/access context:
  - B. Braun uses **IQVIA data delivered in Power BI**.
  - Hospital-level data access is hard; interest in a member-permission approach and/or modeled “expected spend” to infer compliance.

## Decisions / confirmations
- Purchase confirmed: **“Bill confirmed paying ~$150K for two Performance Group (PG) data contracts —one data-only, one data + services.”**
- Priority alignment: **“Compliance as the #1 priority across Bill/Anita/Tracy.”**
- Timing context confirmed: **“Calendar fiscal year (new FY begins January), so timing and reporting should align to that cadence.”**

## Open questions
- Outcomes linkage: Ability to **“link compliance to clinical outcomes”** (e.g., DEHP-free conversion vs. outcomes) — feasibility/approach **unknown**.
- Marketing evidence: Whether MI can show **“outcome or practice benefits for highly compliant IV-solutions portfolios”** — **unknown**.
- Compliance gap drivers: Bill’s request for the **“why” behind gaps** (reasons hospitals buy on/off contract) — specific taxonomy/root-cause method **unknown**.
- National compliance modeling: Details of **modeled “expected spend” by hospital/IDN** approach and accuracy — **unknown**.
- “X” target: Pilot goal includes **“+X pp NRFit penetration”** — X value **unknown**.

## Action items (with owners if present)
- **Get proposal on PG (incl. services) across all PG categories.** Owner: **unknown**.
- **Scope SOW for National (esp. IV) compliance effort** including: **“triangulate gaps, measure typical volume by hosp. type.”** Owner: **unknown**.
- **Work proactively through disruption example occurring now. Live view would be very helpful.** Owner: **unknown**.
- Stakeholder engagement: **“Phil suggested pulling in additional stakeholders (sales/marketing content owners)”** and is open to an in-person executive session in **Allentown (PA)**. Owner: **Phil** (last name unknown).

## Notable metrics/claims (exact phrases where possible)
- Forecast horizon: **“8–10-week, family-level unit forecasts”**
- Pilot outcome targets (examples listed):
  - **“maintain ≥90% fill in 2 surge regions during an event”**
  - **“+3–5 pp on-contract share at 10 priority accounts”**
  - **“−20% distributor partial-fills on top SKUs”**
  - **“≥95% post-conversion PIVC adoption in 60 days”**
  - **“+X pp NRFit penetration in two lagging regions”**
- Purchase amount: **“~$150K”** for **“two Performance Group (PG) data contracts —one data-only, one data + services.”**
- DEHP timing note: **“noted 2030 conversion horizon.”**
