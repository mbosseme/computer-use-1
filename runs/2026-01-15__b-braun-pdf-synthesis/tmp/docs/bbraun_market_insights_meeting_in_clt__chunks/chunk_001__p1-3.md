## Chunk 1 (pages 1-3)

## Key points
- Meeting: **“BBraun Market Insights Meeting in CLT”** on **11/3/2025 1:00 PM** (CLT-BET-340) to discuss **Market Insights (Supply Chain tech data)** with B. Braun.
- Engagement/tone: **Most engaged** were **Bill Miller, Anita Zado, Tracy Butryn**; tone was **“Highly receptive, especially to compliance analytics and services support; strong interest in making insights actionable.”**
- Primary themes:
  - **“Compliance is key focus, esp. in IV.”**
  - **“Patient safety is the other key focus.”**
  - Interest in working proactively through a **current disruption** and having a **“Live view”**.
- Proposed MI capabilities for B. Braun included:
  - **Shortage radar** (real-time disruption visibility; SKU drops/spikes, switching, competitor recovery).
  - **IV Solutions (National lens)**: **“8–10-week, family-level unit forecasts (Excel-ready)”**, anomaly alerts, and **“recoupling” tracking**.
  - **Safety IV Catheters**: geo heatmaps (3-digit ZIP/county), conversion targeting, post-conversion adoption monitoring (reversion/dual-brand leakage).
  - **Regional Anesthesia**: **“NRFit adoption map”**, procedure-to-kit penetration, link to clinical education (ERAS/opioid-sparing).
  - **Channel & distributors**: fill-rate/partial-fill/lead-time/substitution flags; escalation playbook.
  - **Program performance**: compliance/leakage watchlists; dual-award risk; clawback targets.
  - **ESG & safety**: benchmarking **PVC/DEHP-free** and closed-system adoption; value-analysis narrative support.
  - Delivery approach: **family-level defaults**, SKU drilldowns for exceptions, **“monthly refresh with alerting”**, Excel exports + dashboards for QBRs.
- Data/access context:
  - B. Braun uses **IQVIA data delivered in Power BI**.
  - It’s **“hard for B. Braun to obtain hospital data directly.”**
  - Interest in **member-permission** approach (“Lindsay’s form”) to share actual compliance views; otherwise use modeled **“expected spend”** to infer compliance.
- Additional interests raised:
  - **“DEHP-free targeting, pediatric.”**
  - **“Interesting in OLM vs. independent split in non-acute.”**
  - Align timing/reporting to **calendar fiscal year** (“new FY begins January”).

## Decisions / confirmations
- Purchase confirmed: **“Purchased today: Bill confirmed paying ~$150K for two Performance Group (PG) data contracts —one data-only, one data + services.”**
- Agreement focus confirmed: **“IV/IV-therapy is a National-only agreement; they want compliance visibility across National accounts.”**

## Open questions
- Outcomes linkage: Can they **“link compliance to clinical outcomes”** by comparing DEHP-free converted vs. non-converted facilities/regions? (method/details unknown)
- Marketing evidence request: Can MI show **“outcome or practice benefits for highly compliant IV-solutions portfolios”** (for marketing content)?
- Non-acute segmentation: What is the best approach to analyze **OLM vs. independent** non-acute facilities and **compare growth rates**? (data definitions unknown)
- Stakeholder expansion: Which additional stakeholders (sales/marketing content owners) should be included and when? (unknown)

## Action items (with owners if present)
- **Get proposal on PG (incl. services) across all PG categories.** (Owner: unknown)
- **Scope SOW for National (esp. IV) compliance effort** including **“triangulate gaps”** and **“measure typical volume by hosp. type.”** (Owner: unknown)
- Use a current disruption as a proactive working example: **“Work proactively through disruption example occurring now.”** (Owner: unknown)
- Explore data-access enablement via **member permission**: **“Member-permission path (Lindsay’s form)”**. (Owner: Lindsay implied; exact owner unknown)
- Consider adding stakeholders + possible in-person session: **“Phil suggested pulling in additional stakeholders… and is open to an in-person executive session in Allentown (PA).”** (Owner: Phil)

## Notable metrics/claims (exact phrases where possible)
