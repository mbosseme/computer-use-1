## Chunk 1 (pages 1-4)

## Key points
- Email thread and meeting invite focused on preparing a “Market Insights” pitch deck for **B. Braun**.
- **Sachin Shah** plans to **reuse the deck presented to JnJ last week** as the starting point for the B. Braun presentation; much content still referenced JnJ at the time (“I haven’t had a chance to update it yet”).
- Team members were asked to **add their respective sections directly** into the shared file: “**Market Insights - B Braun - Nov 2025.pptx**”.
- **Performance Groups (PG) team** wants to **own their section of the slides**; others should coordinate before adding PG content (“please tag them, or reach to TiYany before adding it to the deck”).
- **Audrey Siepiela** reviewed the performance group slides and **did not add anything**, noting B. Braun has “**a few somewhat active users**” and that additional screenshots beyond the existing “conversion explorer slide” seemed unnecessary.
- **Tiffany (TiYany) Hughes** asked for an **ETA on the deck framework** to ensure timely insertion and review of her “contract performance slides” ahead of the Monday meeting.

## Decisions / confirmations
- Deck approach confirmed: **reuse prior JnJ deck as foundation** for B. Braun presentation (owner stated: Sachin).
- Process confirmation: **PG team will own their slide section**; others should not add PG items without coordinating with TiYany/PG team.
- Audrey confirmed **no additional PG screenshots** were needed beyond current content (based on observed user activity).

## Open questions
- **ETA on the deck framework** (explicitly requested by Tiffany; answer not included in this chunk).
- Whether **TiYany and Matt** believe anything is missing from PG content (“let TiYany and I know if you think they missed anything”) — outcome **unknown**.

## Action items (with owners if present)
- **Sachin Shah**: Update/revise reused JnJ deck content for B. Braun (“working on revisions today and tomorrow”).
- **All recipients / contributors**: “Please feel free to begin adding your respective sections directly to this file.”
- **Matthew Bossemeyer / TiYany Hughes**: Review for missing PG items if Audrey flags gaps (“let TiYany and I know if you think they missed anything”) — completion **unknown**.
- **Tiffany (TiYany) Hughes**: Add “contract performance slides” once deck framework is available; also requested guidance/ETA (dependency **unknown**).
