## Chunk 1 (pages 1-30)

## Key points
- Document is a **Premier Inc. “Market Insights / Data & Analytics”** deck dated **Jan 2026**, describing the **Premier Market Insights (PMI)** data source and analytics/services for the **U.S. acute care market**.
- PMI data types include **“PO, invoice, inventory, cross-reference and master data”**, delivered via a **“Customized dashboard”** with **“Daily Data updates.”**
- PMI use cases highlighted for stakeholders (enterprise teams, sales/marketing/distribution, procurement/demand planning, product/portfolio marketing, national accounts) include:
  - **Contract Performance** (SURPASS and AscenDrive compliance monitoring; cross-reference updates)
  - **Segmentation & Targeting** (market share/opportunity; targeting aligned to performance goals)
  - **Supply Chain Resiliency** (demand surge identification; competitor disruption risk)
  - **Demand Forecasting** (dynamic inventory optimization; calibrate production/allocation)
  - **Market Expansion** (value/feasibility of expansion)
  - **Channel Partner Management** (distributor demand fulfillment, substitutions, SLAs)
- Proposed **Premier / B. Braun Market Insights Partnership** includes continuing current compliance subscriptions, expanding compliance subscriptions, and a **6-category IV custom analytics engagement**, plus optional add-ons (capital refresh recency; DEHP/PVC-free targeting).
- Contract performance support recommendations (priority order) emphasize:
  - **Safety ID Catheter**: “AscenDrive is a key target due to incumbent dual awarded supplier leaving the market”
  - **Regional Anesthesia Trays**: complicated due to exclusion of custom trays; PMI can help navigate
  - **Laparoscopic Surgical Instruments** and **Instrument Container**: “Don’t recommend due to discretionary” (and limited opportunity size / “N/A” spend complexity)
- Portfolio/supply analytics examples for B. Braun include category performance, ASP trends (blinded example), supply trends vs competition, shortage risk projection, hospital consumption signal post-disruption, and inventory “bleed-down.”

## Decisions / confirmations
- **Recommended** (but not explicitly confirmed as agreed/approved in the text): “Recommended Premier/B Braun Market Insights Partnership” (details repeated on pages 4 and 30).
