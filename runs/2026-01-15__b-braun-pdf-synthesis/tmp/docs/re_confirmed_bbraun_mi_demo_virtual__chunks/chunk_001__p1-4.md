## Chunk 1 (pages 1-4)

## Key points
- Jennifer Gotto (B. Braun) reset expectations after internal discussions: B. Braun is **“not in a position to move toward a large-scale investment or full engagement of the Custom Analytics Services outlined.”**
- B. Braun needs more time to **“assess the potential value,”** understand how it complements existing data sources, and build a longer-term business case (Jen notes she is **“still getting grounded in my role”**).
- Any near-term work would need to be **“a very limited, tightly scoped exploratory project (focused on a single category at the facility level)”** to evaluate usefulness, gaps filled, and alignment with internal priorities.
- A small pilot would be used to **compare** Premier’s dataset vs. what B. Braun already receives and decide whether incremental insights justify deeper engagement.
- Matthew Bossemeyer (Premier) followed up seeking direction on an engagement approach and a more detailed proposal; he suggested Custom Analytics Services focused on the **“6 Category IV Ecosystem”** to combine **“hospital ERP + Rx wholesaler data”** into a full spend picture.
- Premier referenced two use cases discussed previously:
  - **“Targeting leakage / cross-selling / compliance gaps”** (prioritize committed facilities / high IV fluid share to identify leakage in adjacent categories)
  - **“Portfolio Gap Analysis”** (where B. Braun is missing participating items competitors have momentum in)

## Decisions / confirmations
- Confirmed direction from B. Braun: if proceeding soon, it must be **strictly exploratory** and **narrow**, not a broad engagement (limited pilot; single category; facility level).
- Confirmed limitation: **“At this time, we would only explore a narrow, category-specific proof-of-concept and not the full set of use cases discussed last week.”**

## Open questions
- What **single category** would the **“very limited, tightly scoped exploratory project”** focus on? (unknown)
- When will B. Braun provide the **CAPS SKU list** needed for the sample data cut/validation? (unknown timeline)
- Whether B. Braun wants to include add-ons **“Capital Refresh”** or **“DEHP/PVC-Free”** (Jen says not ready; Matt asks to decide).
- Whether B. Braun will accept a **30-minute sync next week** / a **short call next week** to align on the minimal pilot scope (not confirmed).

## Action items (with owners if present)
- **B. Braun (Jen / internal team):** Continue gathering the **“CAPS SKU List”**; **“Once we have it, we can share it so that the sample cut can be produced for validation.”**
- **Premier (Matt / team):** After receiving SKU list, **“produce the sample quickly to validate our coverage across the ERP and Rx wholesaler data”** and **“include a data dictionary with the sample.”**
- **Jake (B. Braun) / Premier:** Ensure **“Jake’s feedback on seeing the pharmacy admixture representativeness”** is captured during validation (priority).
- **Both parties:** Potentially schedule a short call / **“30-minute sync next week”** to align on a minimal pilot scope (owner not explicitly assigned).
