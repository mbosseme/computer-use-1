## Chunk 1 (pages 1-1)

## Key points
- Meeting: “Confirmed-BBraun MI Demo -virtual” (Microsoft Teams), dated **1/9/2026 1:00 PM**.
- Purpose (B Braun): regroup with a smaller marketing-focused group to **go deeper on Premier “Market Insights” / market intelligence** (prior session spent “a lot around the contract compliance component”).
- Premier overviewed Market Insights:
  - Data sources include **hospital ERP** transactions (purchase orders, invoices, inventory levels) plus **pharmaceutical wholesaler tracings** (mentioned for completing pharmacy-related purchasing view).
  - Capabilities discussed: facility-level (and potentially department/cost center) analysis, segmentation/targeting, cross-sell, portfolio gap analysis, taxonomy mapping, competitive intelligence, and dashboards vs data feeds.
- Custom “triple play” cross-sell concept discussed for B Braun:
  - Focus on identifying cross-sell/leakage across related IV ecosystem categories; B Braun clarified the commercial framing is more outpatient-focused, but the “framework… would apply anywhere” (bag-to-patient “fluid path portfolio” pull-through).
- Data blinding: Premier described providing targeted insights while keeping facilities blinded; they may show geography like state and “three-digit zip code” (county) while not revealing identities in standard views.

## Decisions / confirmations
- Scope focus for this call: **de-emphasize / skip contract compliance** discussion and focus on the market insights side.
  - Tracy: “that’s not really relevant to this group… dive in on the market side of things.”
- Data coverage clarified/confirmed in discussion:
  - Premier indicated they see **“everything these hospitals are buying, not just what is on contract”** when purchasing is in the ERP.
- Premier confirmed they can provide a comprehensive purchasing view by combining ERP + wholesaler tracings:
  - “we can get a comprehensive view… by taking what’s coming out of the ERP and putting it together with those pharmaceutical wholesaler tracings…”

## Open questions
- Product/system data sources:
  - Claire asked: “Are you accessing any of their pharmacy management systems in addition as a data source?” Premier response: **“Not to my knowledge.”**
- Category definition/detail:
  - Jake asked what granularity is included in “infusion sets and accessories” and whether Premier can show “a granularity of what’s included in that category?” (Premier: “we could pull that up.”)
- Analysis workflow questions raised live:
  - Jake asked if filtering is possible to identify accounts with high share in a category (example: IV fluids “70% or above”) and then evaluate what’s missing in another category (pharmacy/compounding column). (Answer in this chunk: **unknown**; conversation continues beyond provided text.)

## Action items (with owners if present)
- **Internal debrief and decide preferred engagement direction**; then follow up with Premier.  
  - Owner(s): **Tracy, Jennifer, “B Braun team”** (explicitly listed in “Follow-up tasks”).
- **Send Premier a SKU list for CAPS and related categories** to receive a sample data cut / validate representation.  
  - Owner: **Claire** (explicitly listed in “Follow-up tasks”).
- Share supporting materials (offered during discussion; timing not specified):
  - Premier to share **data dictionary / attribute lists** and potentially **sample data**.  
    - Owner: **Matt Bossemeyer / Premier team** (offered; exact deliverable date **unknown**).

## Notable metrics/claims (exact phrases where possible)
- Coverage and composition:
  - “covering **approximately 55% of US hospitals** (mostly Premier members, with **15-20% non-members**)”
  - “and about **25% of non-acute purchasing**”
- Data freshness:
  - “updated with **low latency**, with a significant portion **refreshed daily**”
- Data provenance / differentiation claims:
  - “Premier collects detailed purchasing data directly from hospital ERP systems, including **purchase orders, invoices, and inventory levels**”
  - Dataset described as “more granular and accurate than industry sources like **IQVIA or Clarivate**” because “it is used by the providers themselves for operational purposes”
- Engagement preferences noted:
  - B Braun described “current practice of extracting data for use in their own **Power BI** reports,” but interest in “starting with Premier’s tailored dashboards” while requesting “visibility into the underlying data attributes for validation.”
