## Chunk 3 (pages 1-1)

## Key points
- The app is currently **“acute ERP focused”** and **“we don't have the pharmaceutical wholesale flowing in here yet.”**
- Current view represents **“only… half of it”** (i.e., missing the pharmaceutical wholesale picture).
- A potential near-term path is to pursue **hospital opportunities** based on **“what they buy through their ERP, not as much the pharmaceutical picture.”**
- Pharmaceutical wholesale data is expected to be added: **“We'll roll that data in probably in the next… three or four months.”**
- The app is positioned as **“the lightweight way to get started”**, and will be **“very enhanced over time,”** but **“it's not customized obviously.”**
- Alternatives discussed include **custom dashboards** and potentially **data feeds**: **“a couple of different custom dashboards… even go into the data feeds.”**
- Team offered a **follow-up demo** after internal reconvening to focus on the **“best use case that has the most value.”**
- Feedback from attendees:
  - Presenter addressed prior follow-up items; however, much of the audience was new to the solution.
  - The demo helped show how to identify **portfolio gaps**, filter to **committed members**, and quantify gaps via **“expected to reality.”**
  - A newcomer appreciated seeing **“the art of the possible.”**
- Presenter offered to **“scope something small just to get started”** to build trust in the dataset/service.

## Decisions / confirmations
- Confirmed current scope limitation: app is **acute ERP-focused** and does **not yet** include pharmaceutical wholesale data.
- Confirmed expected timeline to add pharmaceutical wholesale data: **“three or four months.”**
- Confirmed the demo met expectations from at least one key stakeholder: **“you hit on some of the follow-up items.”**

## Open questions
- Whether **“the Premier taxonomy is OK”** (dependency for the proposed path).
- What specific **internal use case** will be chosen as **“the best use case that has the most value.”**
- Whether the team wants to proceed with the **app**, **custom dashboards**, and/or **data feeds** (preference not decided here).

## Action items
- **Client team (owners unknown):** Reconvene internally and determine **the best/highest-value use case**; then inform the presenters to proceed / schedule follow-up.
- **Presenters / Market Insights team (owners not explicitly assigned):**
  - Offer/perform a **follow-up demo** tailored to the chosen use case.
  - Optionally **scope something small** to start and build trust in the data/service.
  - Plan to **roll in pharmaceutical wholesale data** in **“three or four months.”**

## Notable metrics/claims (exact phrases where possible)
- **“expected to reality”** comparison used to identify/quantify portfolio gaps.
- **“we are supposed to be getting at least 80% market share”** (stated expectation for committed members; context suggests this is a benchmark to assess gaps).
- Timeline claim: **“three or four months”** to roll in pharmaceutical wholesale data.
