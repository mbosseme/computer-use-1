## Chunk 1 (pages 1-1)

## Key points
- “Lots of initial interest, esp. from Carmel (VP sales).”
- “Jennifer (their demand planner) went out on leave and we lost momentum.” Follow-up opportunity noted.
- Marketing questions to validate demand and switching behavior:
  - Whether a “large order that has been sitting out there for 90 days” is still needed vs. alternate supply already received.
  - When hospitals switch to an alternative, how long they stay before switching back.
- Suggested approach: “Focus on top volume SKUs initially.”
- Forecast challenges: “Practice changes drive mix changes that cause poor forecasts,” often driven by “physician preference” (e.g., physician leaves and supplier isn’t notified).
- Demand planning (Jennifer) inputs include: “Standard SIOP process,” “Historical sales,” “Market View (marketing’s estimate of growth potential 18 months),” “Sales team’s estimates,” and “Seasonality.”
- Distributor-driven demand: “Most demand comes from distributors –can be lumpy” and they are “blind to the ‘Point of Sale’.”
- Current planning parameters / preferences:
  - “Forecast window of 8 weeks would help.” / “8-10 week forecast window is ideal.”
  - “They typically keep safety stock of 5 weeks.”
  - Output preference: “Raw data in excel is best output.”
  - “Current forecast is by month, divided evenly across weeks.”
  - Desire for near-term issue visibility to guide “manual modifiers,” including where it affects competitors.
- Pain control area called out as a current struggle: “regional anesthesia” (Spine, Epidurals, Peripheral nerve block, Combined).
- Data/rights question raised: “Have the hospitals given you rights to use this data?”
- Sales context: “Teleflex troubles spilled over to B. Braun,” and they “current ramp up fast enough” (exact wording as written); B. Braun protects customers via “restricting / going on allocation.”
- Requirement: “Need to have at SKU level if possible.”

## Decisions / confirmations
- Next-step approach agreed: “dive deeply into a single category (regional anesthia –epidurals), show the data that Jennifer would actually receive.”

## Open questions
- Is the “large order…sitting out there for 90 days” still needed, or has the hospital received “an alternate supply”?
- When a hospital switches to an alternative, “how long are they going to stay with it before they switch back?”
- “Have the hospitals given you rights to use this data?” (data rights/permission status unknown)

## Action items (with owners if present)
- Carmel (VP sales) to “send list of all SKUs.”
- Team to:
  - “Match, then forecast at month level for 3 months out.”
  - Do analysis for “whole group as well as individual SKU level if time allows.”
  - Prepare deep-dive on “regional anesthia –epidurals” showing “the data that Jennifer would actually receive.”
