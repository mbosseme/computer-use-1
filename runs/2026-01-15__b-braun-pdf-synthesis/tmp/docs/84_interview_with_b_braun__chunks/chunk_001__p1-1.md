## Chunk 1 (pages 1-1)

## Key points
- Marketing focus: “Focus on top volume SKUs initially.”
- Forecast accuracy issues: “Practice changes drive mix changes that cause poor forecasts,” often driven by “physician preference” (e.g., “physician leaves practice, supplier is not notified”).
- Current planning inputs/process (Jennifer – Demand Planner):
  - “Historical”
  - “Standard SIOP process”
  - “Market View (marketing’s estimate of growth potential 18 months)” including “Sales team’s estimates”
  - “Seasonality”
- Demand characteristics:
  - “Most demand comes from distributors –can be lumpy”
  - Distributors “are blind to the ‘Point of Sale’” (note: comparison mentioned to retailers getting “POS data from Walmart”)
- Inventory/forecasting preferences:
  - “Forecast window of 8 weeks would help”; “They typically keep safety stock of 5 weeks.”
  - “8-10 week forecast window is ideal.”
  - “Raw data in excel is best output.”
  - “Current forecast is by month, divided evenly across weeks.”
  - Better near-term issue visibility is helpful to guide “manual modifiers,” especially “where it is affecting competitors.”
- Categorization/aggregation:
  - They have “their own categorization hierarchy” and can “add incremental quantity at higher levels that are then allocated down.”
- Area of current difficulty: “Struggling currently in pain control area (regional anesthesia)” (Spine / Epidurals / Peripheral nerve block / Combined).

## Decisions / confirmations
- Confirmation of approach/next steps: “dive deeply into a single category (regional anesthia –epidurals), show the data that Jennifer would actually receive,” then “forecast at month and week level” for “whole group as well as individual SKU.”
- Confirmed need: “Need to have at SKU level if possible.”

## Open questions
- Alan (Director of Demand Planning): “Is this large order that has been sitting out there for 90 days still really needed? Has the hospital already received an alternate supply?”
- Alan: “When a hospital switches to use an alternative (if a BBraun alt?), how long are they going to stay with it before they switch back?”
- POS visibility: extent/availability of true “Point of Sale” data is unknown.

## Action items (with owners if present)
- Carmel (VP Sales) to send “list of all SKUs.”
- Team (owner unknown) to:
  - “Match, then forecast at month and week level.”
  - “Do for whole group as well as individual SKU.”
  - Provide an example “single category” deep dive (regional anesthesia—epidurals) and “show the data that Jennifer would actually receive.”

## Notable metrics/claims (exact phrases)
- “Forecast window of 8 weeks would help.”
- “They typically keep safety stock of 5 weeks.”
- “8-10 week forecast window is ideal.”
- “Current forecast is by month, divided evenly across weeks.”
- “Most demand comes from distributors –can be lumpy.”
- Large order aging: “large order that has been sitting out there for 90 days”
- Supply disruption note: “Teleflex troubles spilled over to B. Braun, they current ramp up fast enough.” (meaning unclear/possibly transcription; exact phrasing preserved)
- Allocation behavior: “B. Braun tries to protect current customers by restricting / going on allocation.”
