## Chunk 1 (pages 1-1)

## Key points
- Marketing (Pete) wants to **“Focus on top volume SKUs initially.”**
- **Practice changes** can shift product mix and lead to **poor forecasts**; often driven by **physician preference** (e.g., physician leaves a practice and **“supplier is not notified”**).
- Demand planning inputs/process (Jennifer):
  - Uses **historical** data and a **“Standard SIOP process.”**
  - Uses a **Market View** (marketing estimate of growth potential over **“18 months”**) plus **sales team estimates**.
  - Accounts for **seasonality**.
- Demand signal challenges:
  - **“Most demand comes from distributors – can be lumpy”** and they are **“blind to the ‘Point of Sale’”** data.
- Inventory/forecasting preferences:
  - A **“Forecast window of 8 weeks would help”**; they typically keep **“safety stock of 5 weeks.”**
  - **“8-10 week forecast window is ideal.”**
  - Prefers **“Raw data in excel”** as output.
  - Current forecast is **monthly**, then **“divided evenly across weeks.”**
- Current pain point/category:
  - **“Struggling currently in pain control area (regional anesthesia)”** including **Spine, Epidurals, Peripheral nerve blocks, Combined**.
- Need for near-term issue visibility:
  - **“Understanding where there will be problems in the near future is also helpful”** to guide manual forecast modifiers, including where it affects competitors.
- Demand planning questions (Alan):
  - Whether a **“large order…sitting out there for 90 days”** is still needed or if the hospital already found alternate supply.
  - When hospitals switch to an alternative (e.g., **“if a BBraun alt?”**), **“how long are they going to stay with it before they switch back?”**
- Sales perspective (Carmel):
  - **“Teleflex troubles spilled over to B. Braun”** and they **“current ramp up fast enough”** (wording unclear; exact meaning unknown).
  - B. Braun protects current customers by **“restricting / going on allocation.”**
  - Need forecasting **“at SKU level if possible.”**

## Decisions / confirmations
- Agreed **next step approach**: **“dive deeply into a single category (regional anesthia – epidurals)”** and **“show the data that Jennifer would actually receive.”**
- Confirmation that output should support **month and week level** forecasting and include both **group-level and individual SKU** views.

## Open questions
- Is the **90-day outstanding large order** still valid demand, or has the hospital already sourced an alternative? *(Alan)*
- When a hospital switches to an alternative supplier/product, **how long until they switch back**? *(Alan)*
- Meaning/intent behind: **“they current ramp up fast enough”** (unclear; exact interpretation unknown).

## Action items
- **Carmel** to **“send list of all SKUs.”**
- Team to:
  - **Match** the SKUs/data.
  - Build a forecast **“at month and week level”** for:
    - the **whole group** and
    - each **individual SKU**
  - Focus initial deep dive on **regional anesthesia – epidurals**.

## Notable metrics/claims (exact phrases where possible)
