## Chunk 3 (pages 1-1)

## Key points
- The current app is “**acute ERP focused**” and “**we don't have the pharmaceutical wholesale flowing in here yet**,” meaning it only reflects part of the overall picture right now.
- A potential near-term path is to pursue opportunities tied to “**hospitals and what they buy through their ERP**,” rather than the full pharmaceutical view.
- Pharmaceutical wholesale data is expected to be added later: “**We'll roll that data in probably in the next, I think three or four months.**”
- The app is described as “**the lightweight way to get started**,” expected to be “**very enhanced over time**,” but “**not customized**.”
- Alternative options discussed include “**different custom dashboards**” and potentially going “**into the data feeds**.”
- Vendor offered a follow-up demo after the client reconvenes internally to identify the “**best use case that has the most value**.”
- Client feedback indicated the demo addressed prior follow-up items (from earlier sessions with a different audience) and helped show “the art of the possible.”

## Decisions / confirmations
- Confirmation that the current solution view is partial: client acknowledged “**this only has half of it**.”
- No explicit decision captured; evaluation is ongoing (“**It's it's just a big decision**…”).

## Open questions
- Whether “**the Premier taxonomy is OK**” (required to pursue the outlined path) — status unknown.
- Which “**best use case that has the most value**” the client wants to start with — unknown.
- Whether the client wants the “lightweight” app approach vs. “custom dashboards” / “data feeds” — unknown.
- What exact “parameters” define “what we can and cannot do” — unknown.

## Action items (with owners if present)
- Client to reconvene internally and identify the best initial use case; then inform vendor (“**once you reconvene internally… just let us know**”). **Owner: client team (specific person unknown)**.
- Vendor offered to “**do a follow-up demo**” after client alignment. **Owner: vendor team (names present: Bossemeyer, Matthew / Shah, Sachin)**.
- Vendor to “**roll that [pharmaceutical wholesale] data in… in the next… three or four months**.” **Owner: vendor team**.
- Vendor offered to “**scope something small just to get started**” to help “**build trust**” in the dataset/service. **Owner: Bossemeyer, Matthew (vendor)**.

## Notable metrics/claims (exact phrases where possible)
- Timeline claim: “**We'll roll that data in probably in the next, I think three or four months.**”
- Market share expectation mentioned by client: “**we are supposed to be getting at least 80% market share**” and “**there's a gap within that on each category level**.”
- Capability claim: ability to “**filter down to our committed members**,” show “**expected to reality**,” and “**drill down… and see that and quantify it**.”
