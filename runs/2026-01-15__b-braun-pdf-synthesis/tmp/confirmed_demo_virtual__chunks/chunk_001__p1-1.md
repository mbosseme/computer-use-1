## Chunk 1 (pages 1-1)

## Key points
- Meeting purpose: regroup with a smaller B. Braun marketing-focused group to “take a deeper dive on the marketing insights component” (vs. prior focus on contract compliance / Ascend Drive).
- Premier team (Matt Bossemeyer, Sachin Shah, Audrey Siepiela) presented Premier Market Insights data sources, coverage, granularity/blinding approach, and demo concepts for segmentation/targeting and cross-sell.
- Data sources described:
  - Purchasing data pulled “directly from the ERP system,” including “purchase orders, their invoices, their inventory levels data.”
  - Supplemented with “pharmaceutical wholesaler tracings” (noted especially for pharmacy/fluid purchasing visibility).
- Data quality/latency positioning:
  - Premier emphasized hospitals use the same data operationally, creating incentives to correct issues (e.g., “blanket PO,” “canceled orders”).
  - Mentioned “low latency” and that “a significant portion [is] refreshed daily.” (Exact proportion unknown.)
- Granularity & privacy:
  - Analysis can be “at a facility level” and in many cases down to “cost center” / “department,” while “maintaining blinding to protect member identities.”
  - Location context shown via “state” and “three-digit zip code” / “county.”
- Custom analysis concept highlighted: “triple play” cross-sell/leakage across related IV ecosystem categories; requested ability to filter/sort for targeting use cases.

## Decisions / confirmations
- Confirmed scope for this meeting: de-emphasize contract compliance content.
  - Tracy: “that’ll…not really [be] relevant to this group. We really just wanted to dive in on the market side of things.”
  - Matt: “OK. Then we’ll skip that for today.”
- Confirmed Premier can see purchases beyond contract:
  - “everything these hospitals are buying, not just what is on contract… regardless if it’s on or off contract.”
- Confirmed data sourcing approach:
  - ERP visibility includes Premier’s ERP (“Premier actually acquired an ERP system… It was called Aparic… So it’s Premier’s ERP.”) plus connections to other ERPs via “workday APIs” / cloud-based streaming.
- Confirmed coverage approach for pharmacy-related gaps (per Premier):
  - Premier can “get a comprehensive view” by combining “what’s coming out of the ERP” with “pharmaceutical wholesaler tracings.”
- Confirmed “triple play” framing (with nuance):
  - Tracy: commercially launched more in outpatient, but “the framework… would apply anywhere… full fluid path portfolio… bag to patient.”

## Open questions
- Coverage/definition clarification:
  - Jennifer asked to confirm: “it’s 25% of the acute care market with 80% of it being Premier data with the remainder being non Premier.” (Premier response referenced other GPOs using Premier tools; final clarified percentage breakdown = unknown.)
- Pharmacy system access:
  - Claire: “Are you accessing any of their pharmacy management systems…?” Premier: “Not to my knowledge.”
- Category definition / taxonomy:
  - Jake: “Do you have… granularity of what’s included in [the] infusion sets and accessories… category?” (Premier said they could “pull that up” but it wasn’t shown in this chunk.)
- Filtering use case (posed, not completed in this chunk):
  - Jake requested a “live example” to filter to accounts “70% or above on IV fluids” and then identify what’s missing in “IV therapy, pharmacy, compounding.” (Outcome not included on this page.)

  - “about **25% of non-acute purchasing**”
  - Jennifer’s restatement for confirmation: “**25% of the acute care market** with **80%** of it being Premier data…” (final confirmed numbers beyond this restatement = unknown)
