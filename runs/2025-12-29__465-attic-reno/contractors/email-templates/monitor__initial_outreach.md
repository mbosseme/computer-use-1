Subject: Project monitor / industrial hygiene support — attic vermiculite + bat guano (East Aurora)

Hi <Name>,

We’re looking to hire an independent project monitor / industrial hygienist for a residential project in East Aurora, NY.

If helpful, here’s a one-page scope packet you can skim first:
- `runs/2025-12-29__465-attic-reno/contractors/monitor/SCOPE_PACKET.md`

Scope summary:
- Attic has Zonolite vermiculite (confirmed via Zonolite Trust; treated as ACM).
- There is also residual dried bat guano from a prior infestation (bats excluded).
- House is late-1800s balloon framing; we’ve seen occasional intact vermiculite flakes indoors and outdoors.
- Plan is attic-access abatement now, then air-sealing + reinsulation + an interior lid; reroof later.

We’re looking for help with:
1) Reviewing/defining the scope and writing a simple RFP/spec for bidders
2) Oversight during the abatement (as appropriate)
3) Final clearance testing and a written clearance report (TEM preferred if appropriate)

A few questions:
- Are you NY-certified and available in <May–June target window>?
- What clearance approach do you recommend (TEM vs PCM) for this scenario and what’s the typical turnaround?
- Do you support residential vermiculite projects and balloon framing migration controls?
- What would you need from us to give a ballpark cost and timeline?

If you’re open to it, we’d love to schedule a short call this week.

Thanks,
<M.B.>
