# Monitor / Industrial Hygienist — Scope Packet (Generic)

Project: Attic Zonolite vermiculite (ACM) + bat guano remediation
Location: East Aurora, NY (ZIP 14052)
Home: late-1800s balloon-frame, historic finishes (plaster/trim)

## 1) Situation summary
- Attic contains **Zonolite vermiculite** (confirmed via Zonolite Trust; treat as asbestos-containing material).
- Attic also contains **dried bat guano** from a prior infestation (bats currently excluded; guano remains).
- We’ve occasionally found **intact vermiculite flakes** indoors at baseboards/shoe molding and outdoors (deck/yard). No known active chases identified yet.

## 2) Strategy / owner decisions
- **Approach:** attic-access abatement now; **roof replacement later** (~2–3 years) as a conventional reroof with guardrails.
- **Attic mechanicals:** remove the disconnected attic HVAC/air handler as part of abatement.
- **Occupancy:** two young children + a dog; we plan to **vacate** during active work and not return until clearance is confirmed.
- **Target end state:** “clean storage” attic plus a robust interior air/particle barrier (“lid”) after abatement.

## 3) What we’re hiring you for (requested services)
We are looking for an **independent** (owner-representative) monitor / industrial hygienist to support:

### A) Pre-bid scope definition (Phase 0)
- Brief review of existing conditions (photos/measurements; optional site visit).
- Confirm whether the work triggers a regulated asbestos project under **NY ICR 56** (we assume yes if a contractor performs removal).
- Provide a clear, residential-friendly **scope/spec** for abatement bidders including:
  - Containment concept (attic access route + critical barriers)
  - Negative pressure/HEPA approach
  - Vermiculite handling assumptions (HEPA vacuum / wet methods; avoid oversaturation)
  - Integration of guano remediation under the same containment
  - Handling/removal plan for attic HVAC/air handler
  - Waste documentation expectations (manifests, labeling)

### B) Abatement oversight (Phase 2)
- Monitor readiness review before start (containment/decon/negative air setup).
- On-site monitoring during key work periods as required/appropriate.
- Perimeter/ambient sampling per your plan and ICR 56 requirements (as applicable).

### C) Clearance + “safe to reoccupy” sign-off (Phase 3)
- Visual clearance inspection.
- Final clearance sampling plan and execution (aggressive sampling if appropriate).
- Written clearance report and explicit **re-occupancy criteria**.

## 4) Key technical sensitivities
- Balloon framing increases air/particle migration potential; we want the plan to explicitly address:
  - attic-to-wall-top interfaces
  - penetrations/chases
  - (where feasible) guidance for sealing stud bays after clearance (handled by insulation/air-seal contractor)
- Historic house: avoid approaches likely to damage plaster keys/trim or saturate assemblies.

## 5) Questions (please answer in your reply)
### Independence / qualifications
- Are you independent of abatement contractors who might bid this work?
- What NY certifications do you hold relevant to this (Project Monitor, Air Sampling Technician, etc.)?
- Do you have experience with **vermiculite** projects and **residential** attic containments?

### Clearance method + sampling plan
- For Libby-type vermiculite, what do you recommend for final clearance: **TEM vs PCM** (and why)?
- What is your proposed sampling plan at a high level:
  - background samples (where/when)
  - daily/perimeter samples (if needed)
  - final clearance sample count/locations
- Lab used, typical turnaround, and rush options.
- If clearance fails: your re-clean/re-test process and what that usually adds in time/cost.

### Logistics / schedule
- Earliest realistic schedule for a site visit + bidding support.
- Preferred execution window (we prefer late spring / early summer).

### Commercials
- How you charge (hourly vs fixed fee) and what you’d expect for:
  - scope/spec drafting support
  - monitoring days on site
  - clearance sampling + report
- Any required deposits/retainers.

## 6) What we can provide
- Attic photos and walkthrough notes (vermiculite depth/coverage, guano locations, access path).
- Approx attic area measurements.
- Photos of indoor/outdoor flake sightings (non-dust).

## 7) Next step
If this fits your practice, we’d like a **20–30 minute call** to confirm approach and request a proposal.
