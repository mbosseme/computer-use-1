# Alexander Chase (Cornelius, NC) — public due diligence notes (ARCHIVED)

This document is **ARCHIVED / NO LONGER ACTIVE**. It is retained for historical context only.

Current active property focus: Vineyard Point / Dockside condos (18861 Vineyard Point Ln, Cornelius, NC 28031).

Scope: information that appears to be publicly available without HOA resale package access. Treat listing narratives as *directional* (often sourced from MLS/agents), and verify in official HOA documents.

## High-confidence identifiers (to avoid name collisions)
- Cornelius, NC 28031; street anchors seen repeatedly in listings: Doe Valley Ct, Deer Valley Dr, McDowell Creek Ct.
- Appears adjacent to / connected with the McDowell Creek Greenway.

## What multiple public sources consistently suggest
### Rental restrictions (important)
- Multiple listing narratives state a **rental cap of 20%** and that it is **currently met with a waitlist**.
  - Example: Compass listing for 17217 Doe Valley Ct: states “Per HOA, rental cap is 20% and currently has a waiting list.”
    - https://www.compass.com/listing/17217-doe-valley-court-cornelius-nc-28031/1327731116248199257/
  - Example: NextHome Choice Realty listing for 17113 Doe Valley Ct: states “Alexander Chase has reached its 20% rental cap and there is currently a waitlist.”
    - https://www.nexthomechoicerealty.com/property/44-4331487-17113-Doe-Valley-Court-Cornelius-NC-28031

- At least one listing narrative states **owner-occupancy required for the first 2 years before renting**.
  - NextHome Choice Realty listing for 17113 Doe Valley Ct: “Owners must occupy for first 2 years before renting.”
    - https://www.nexthomechoicerealty.com/property/44-4331487-17113-Doe-Valley-Court-Cornelius-NC-28031

### HOA dues inclusions / amenities (directional)
- At least one listing explicitly states HOA dues include **water and trash**.
  - NextHome Choice Realty listing for 17113 Doe Valley Ct: “HOA dues include water and trash service.”
    - https://www.nexthomechoicerealty.com/property/44-4331487-17113-Doe-Valley-Court-Cornelius-NC-28031

- Amenities repeatedly mentioned across listings: clubhouse, pool, fitness center, grills/picnic area, walking trails.
  - Compass listing for 17217 Doe Valley Ct includes these amenities.

### HOA / management name (likely but verify)
- Listings reference **Main Street** as the association/management name.
  - NextHome Choice Realty listing: “Association Name | Main Street”.
    - https://www.nexthomechoicerealty.com/property/44-4331487-17113-Doe-Valley-Court-Cornelius-NC-28031

- A separate “community public page” lists **Alexander Chase Homeowners Association, Inc.** with a “main office” address on W. Catawba Ave (not an authoritative HOA record, but a useful string for further searches).

## Strong lead for recorded documents (could unlock legal entity name + declarations)
A Town of Cornelius public agenda PDF includes a table referencing **ALEXANDER CHASE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION, INC.** with Mecklenburg County deed book/page citations:
- “ALEXANDER CHASE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION, INC. DB 26009 PG 35” (also noted as “COS J” and “COS A” in the table)
- “ALEXANDER CHASE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION, INC. DB 19484 PG 158”
- “ALEXANDER CHASE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION, INC. DB 17224 PG 59” (also noted with “PARK 1” / “PARK 2”)

Interpretation: those DB/PG references are *not* proof of reserves/assessments, but they are a high-signal path to the actual recorded declaration/amendments or plats (depending on what the referenced instrument is).

## What I could NOT confirm publicly (still needs HOA docs)
- Reserve funding level / reserve study date and adequacy.
- Any history of special assessments (amounts, timing, purpose).
- Master insurance coverage details ("all-in" vs "bare walls"), deductibles, or claims history.
- Pending litigation, major deferred maintenance, or known building-wide system end-of-life (roofs, siding, plumbing, etc.).

## Questions to ask / documents to request (highest ROI)
1. **Latest reserve study** (and whether it’s been updated in the last 3–5 years).
2. **Current-year budget + year-to-date actuals**.
3. **Current reserve balance** and reserve schedule by component (roof, siding, pavement, etc.).
4. **Special assessments**: any in last 10 years; any approved but not yet billed; any being discussed.
5. **Master insurance declaration page** + HOA claim history + deductible structure (esp. wind/hail/water).
6. **Rental policy** in writing: rental cap %, current percent rented, waitlist length, “2-year occupancy” rule, lease term minimums, and enforcement mechanism.
7. **Recent board meeting minutes** (at least last 6–12 months).
8. **Capital projects list** (completed last 5 years + planned next 5).

## Notes / cautions
- There are similarly named communities in other states (e.g., “Alexander’s Chase” in Virginia). Don’t rely on any source that isn’t clearly tied to Cornelius, NC + the local street anchors above.
- MLS-style listing narratives are useful for leads, but the HOA resale package and recorded declarations are the source of truth.
