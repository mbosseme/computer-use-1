Left ~50% is a dark navy/black solid panel with white title (large, two lines) and three short paragraph bullets (each begins with a bold label + colon, followed by regular-weight sentence). Add a thin, subtle horizontal divider line under the title spanning most of the left panel. Right ~50% is a full-height abstract tech image (blue/purple layered translucent curves with data/line accents). Keep generous left padding and consistent paragraph spacing.",
