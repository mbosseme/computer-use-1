Bottom row has two wide rounded rectangles: left (what stays) and right (transition steps). Use rounded rectangles, subtle drop shadows, white text on dark sections, black/dark text inside light boxes. Add simple vertical arrows between numbered steps; add one leftward arrow from 'Chad Connelly' box into 'Centralized IT backlog'. On FUTURE side add curved arrow/loop annotation labeled 'Funding stays with CoC' between steps 2 and 3 and callouts.",
