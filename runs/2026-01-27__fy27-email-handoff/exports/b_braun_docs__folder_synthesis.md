## Executive Summary (8–12 bullets)

- Across engagements, B. Braun’s most persistent need is **better visibility and decision support across demand, compliance, and service levels**, with recurring emphasis on turning “signals” into action (Docs: **81222_call_with_b_braun**, **b_braun_demo_51523**, **bbraun_market_insights_meeting_in_clt**).
- **Forecasting requirements are not yet fully converged**: one thread prefers **monthly, product-family unit forecasts** to plan shared components (Doc: **81222_call_with_b_braun**), while another pushes for **SKU-level detail** with an **8–10 week operational horizon** (Docs: **84_interview_with_b_braun**, **b_braun_legacy_notes**).
- Demand volatility is repeatedly attributed to **distributor-driven, “lumpy” ordering** and **limited downstream visibility (POS / health-system fulfillment)**, creating planning risk and manual rework (Docs: **84_interview_with_b_braun**, **b_braun_legacy_notes**, **b_braun_demo_51523**).
- B. Braun stakeholders consistently ask for **early-warning indicators** to detect demand inflections, competitor impacts, and disruption-driven shifts (Docs: **84_interview_with_b_braun**, **81222_call_with_b_braun**, **bbraun_market_insights_meeting_in_clt**).
- In IV therapy analytics, scope expanded from IV fluids toward a **holistic “IV ecosystem / triple play” cross-category view**, including privacy-safe facility-level market share and filters such as **DEHP-free** (Docs: **b_braun_follow_up**, **confirmed_bbraun_mi_demo_virtual**).
- From late 2025 onward, **compliance (especially National IV/IV-therapy)** is explicitly elevated as the **#1 priority**, with patient safety as the other core focus (Doc: **bbraun_market_insights_meeting_in_clt**).
- Data strategy is constrained by **hospital/facility-level permissions and disclosure rules**, driving recurring “**name-blind by default**” approaches and/or modeled “expected spend” when permission is absent (Docs: **b_braun_follow_up**, **bbraun_market_insights_meeting_in_clt**, **bbraunpremier_market_insights_virtual**, **premier_market_insights_compliance_measurement_monitoring_support_for_suppliers**).
- Commercially, there is evidence of **active purchases** (e.g., **~$150K for two PG data contracts**) alongside **larger proposed expansions** that remain unapproved/uncertain (Docs: **bbraun_market_insights_meeting_in_clt**, **market_insights_b_braun_nov_2025**, **market_insights_b_braun_jan_2026**).
- By Jan 2026, B. Braun resets near-term expectations to a **strictly exploratory, tightly scoped, single-category facility-level pilot** with success criteria and a go/no-go gate—indicating procurement and scope sensitivity (Doc: **re_confirmed_bbraun_mi_demo_virtual**).
- Operationally, B. Braun’s narrative includes long-running supply challenges (e.g., “shortages for 10 years”) and interest in **disruption monitoring / shortage radar** to manage events proactively (Docs: **b_braun_demo_51523**, **bbraun_market_insights_meeting_in_clt**).

## Themes (with evidence references)

### 1) Forecasting scope tension: product-family/month vs SKU/week; near-term horizon is operationally critical
- Product-family/monthly unit forecast to plan **shared components**; explicitly “more accurate than SKU level” and “less nervousness” (Doc: **81222_call_with_b_braun**).
- Strong desire for **SKU-level detail** “if possible,” with **8–10 week** horizon and Excel raw outputs (Doc: **84_interview_with_b_braun**).
- Additional confirmation of **month-level forecast for ~3 months**, with SKU views “if time allows,” plus deep-dive approach (Doc: **b_braun_legacy_notes**).

**Strategic takeaway:** Align stakeholders on a two-layer output (e.g., product-family monthly for component planning + SKU/weekly for execution) or explicitly choose a single operating model; today requirements conflict across sessions.

---

### 2) Demand signal quality is degraded by distributor behavior and limited downstream visibility
- Demand described as distributor-driven and “lumpy,” with distributors “blind to POS” (Doc: **84_interview_with_b_braun**).
- Repeated concern about large, **aged orders** (e.g., 90 days) and uncertainty whether demand is real or already substituted (Docs: **84_interview_with_b_braun**, **b_braun_legacy_notes**).
- Service visibility gap: B. Braun can see service levels to distributors but not **distributor → health-system** service levels (Doc: **b_braun_demo_51523**).

**Strategic takeaway:** A forecasting and compliance program will underperform unless paired with a defined approach to (a) detect stale orders/substitutions and (b) improve or proxy downstream signals.

---

### 3) “Early warning” + disruption management is a recurring cross-functional need
- Need to interpret “supply chain signals” (competitors falling behind; hospitals recently received a lot of supply) and anticipate spikes/fall-offs (Doc: **81222_call_with_b_braun**).
- Desire for early warning indicators to guide manual forecast modifiers, including competitor impacts (Doc: **84_interview_with_b_braun**).
- Explicit interest in “live view,” “shortage radar,” and proactive disruption management (Doc: **bbraun_market_insights_meeting_in_clt**).

**Strategic takeaway:** Package analytics as an operational workflow (signals → thresholds → actions), not only static reporting.

---

### 4) IV therapy analytics is shifting toward cross-category portfolio strategy (“triple play”), not single-category fluids
- Client feedback reduced focus on IV fluids; more emphasis on “triple play” (bag/tubing/catheter), framed as **five categories (possibly six)** (Doc: **b_braun_follow_up**).
- Market expansion and leakage/cross-sell across related IV categories are core use cases in the MI demo (Doc: **confirmed_bbraun_mi_demo_virtual**).
- Proposed deliverables include **name-blind facility-level market share maps** and target action lists (Docs: **b_braun_follow_up**, **market_insights_b_braun_jan_2026**).

**Strategic takeaway:** The “unit of value” is the IV ecosystem and conversion/leakage across the fluid path—not isolated category views.

---

### 5) Compliance and privacy/permissions are foundational constraints shaping what can be delivered
- Compliance for IV/IV-therapy confirmed as **#1 priority**; IV is a **National-only agreement** needing National compliance visibility (Doc: **bbraun_market_insights_meeting_in_clt**).
- Facility identification constraints: national GPO rules and member permission not scalable; proposed anonymization via zip-3 and blinded facility IDs (Docs: **b_braun_follow_up**, **bbraunpremier_market_insights_virtual**, **premier_market_insights_compliance_measurement_monitoring_support_for_suppliers**).
- Defined approach: “name-blind by default,” stable de-identified IDs; named facilities only via signed permission forms (Doc: **premier_market_insights_compliance_measurement_monitoring_support_for_suppliers**).
- Data rights explicitly raised as a concern (“Have the hospitals given you rights to use this data?”) (Doc: **b_braun_legacy_notes**).

**Strategic takeaway:** Success depends on a permissioning strategy plus a “good enough” name-blind operating model that still drives sales and contracting action.

---

### 6) Commercial packaging is unsettled; pilot-first posture emerges by 2026
- Pricing for IV analytics engagement was unresolved; prior $250K reference vs larger multi-category engagement (Doc: **b_braun_follow_up**).
- Proposed expansions include continuing and new investments (e.g., **$175K/year**, **$165K/year**, **$250K 6-month services**) but approval is not captured (Docs: **market_insights_b_braun_nov_2025**, **market_insights_b_braun_jan_2026**).
- Purchase confirmed: **~$150K** for **two PG data contracts** (one data-only, one data+services) (Doc: **bbraun_market_insights_meeting_in_clt**).
- In Jan 2026, B. Braun explicitly limits near-term to a **small, time-boxed pilot** (Doc: **re_confirmed_bbraun_mi_demo_virtual**).

**Strategic takeaway:** Reduce decision friction via a tightly scoped pilot with measurable success criteria tied to one category and one workflow.

## Notable Decisions / Confirmations

- **Forecast granularity preference (product family/month):** confirmed as desired in one thread (Doc: **81222_call_with_b_braun**).
- **Forecast pilot scope and outputs:** start with **top-volume SKUs**; target **8–10 week** horizon; prefer **Excel raw data**; SKU-level “if possible” (Doc: **84_interview_with_b_braun**).
- **Deep dive approach:** focus initially on **regional anesthesia (epidurals)** and show data in the demand planner’s familiar format (Doc: **b_braun_legacy_notes**).
- **IV analytics scope direction:** expand from fluids-only to **holistic IV therapy** across **five/six categories** (Doc: **b_braun_follow_up**).
- **DEHP feasibility:** DEHP flag exists in PIM; validation pending (Doc: **b_braun_follow_up**).
- **Contracting parameters presented:** pricing firm 24 months, 3% increases years 3–5; disposables indirect only; capital direct only via authorized distributors; price activation requires tier + LOC/PMDF (Doc: **b_braun_presentation_iv_therapy_portfolio_group_purchasing**).
- **Market Insights priority:** compliance (esp. National IV) is #1; patient safety emphasized (Doc: **bbraun_market_insights_meeting_in_clt**).
- **Purchase confirmed:** **~$150K** for two PG data contracts (Doc: **bbraun_market_insights_meeting_in_clt**).
- **Pilot posture confirmed (Jan 2026):** strictly exploratory, single category, facility-level; define success criteria and go/no-go in small SOW (Doc: **re_confirmed_bbraun_mi_demo_virtual**).
- **Internal pitch execution choice:** reuse the JnJ deck as foundation; PG team owns PG slides (Doc: **re_prep_for_market_insights_pitch_to_b_braun**).

## Open Questions / Follow-ups

### Forecasting & demand planning
- Which is the agreed operating target: **product-family monthly** vs **SKU-level** (and how they coexist)? (Docs: **81222_call_with_b_braun**, **84_interview_with_b_braun**)
- What supply-chain “signals” data exists (sources/fields/cadence) and what interpretation framework is expected? (Doc: **81222_call_with_b_braun**)
- How to treat **stale/aged distributor orders** (e.g., 90-day open orders) and quantify substitution duration after switching? (Docs: **84_interview_with_b_braun**, **b_braun_legacy_notes**)
- POS / downstream visibility: can it be obtained or proxied? (Docs: **84_interview_with_b_braun**, **b_braun_legacy_notes**)

### IV therapy analytics scope & deliverables
- Final scope: **five vs six** IV categories; what exactly is in each category (e.g., safety IV catheters inclusion)? (Docs: **b_braun_follow_up**, **confirmed_bbraun_mi_demo_virtual**)
- What is the final template/content for **blinded facility-level market share** deliverables? (Doc: **b_braun_follow_up**)
- DEHP flag validation results from PIM/Fusion (pending) (Doc: **b_braun_follow_up**)

### Compliance, permissions, data rights, and coverage
- How to operationalize National compliance SOW (triangulating gaps; typical volume by hospital type) (Doc: **bbraun_market_insights_meeting_in_clt**)
- Data rights/permissions: do hospitals grant rights, and what is the scalable permission process? (Docs: **b_braun_legacy_notes**, **premier_market_insights_compliance_measurement_monitoring_support_for_suppliers**)
- Market Insights dataset **coverage/representativeness** is explicitly inconsistent and needs validation (Doc: **confirmed_bbraun_mi_demo_virtual**)
- Non-acute segmentation definitions (e.g., “OLM vs independent”) (Doc: **bbraun_market_insights_meeting_in_clt**)
- Limits on pricing analytics: no facility-level pricing; what rollups are allowed and useful? (Doc: **confirmed_bbraun_mi_demo_virtual**)

### Commercials & operating model
- Will B. Braun expand beyond current contracts/subscriptions (e.g., from two to four; proposed annual + 6-month services investments)? (Docs: **bbraunpremier_market_insights_virtual**, **market_insights_b_braun_nov_2025**, **market_insights_b_braun_jan_2026**)
- Post-pilot: engagement model choice (pre-built app vs custom dashboards vs data feed) (Doc: **confirmed_bbraun_mi_demo_virtual**)

## Recommended Next Actions

1. **Run a requirements alignment session (forecasting)** to reconcile: product-family/monthly (component planning) vs SKU-level/8–10 weeks (execution), and agree the canonical output set and cadence (Docs: **81222_call_with_b_braun**, **84_interview_with_b_braun**, **b_braun_legacy_notes**).
2. **Define and execute the Jan 2026 pilot slice**: select the single category (e.g., IV ecosystem slice vs CAPS/503B validation), document success criteria, and set the go/no-go gate in a short SOW (Doc: **re_confirmed_bbraun_mi_demo_virtual**).
3. **Validate dataset fit via sample cuts** using the provided SKU lists (CAPS and/or IV solutions) and explicitly confirm coverage/competitor presence and taxonomy mapping before scaling (Docs: **confirmed_bbraun_mi_demo_virtual**, **re_confirmed_bbraun_mi_demo_virtual**).
4. **Operationalize privacy/permissions**: choose the default name-blind workflow (zip-3 + blinded IDs) and the member-permission pathway for naming, with clear rules for what actions sales can take in each mode (Docs: **b_braun_follow_up**, **premier_market_insights_compliance_measurement_monitoring_support_for_suppliers**, **bbraunpremier_market_insights_virtual**).
5. **Close the DEHP filter dependency** by completing PIM/Fusion validation and defining how DEHP/PVC-free targeting will be surfaced (if in scope for the pilot or later) (Doc: **b_braun_follow_up**).
6. **Specify disruption / early-warning workflows** (alerts, thresholds, and response owners) for shortage radar / “live view,” so analytics connect to actions during events (Doc: **bbraun_market_insights_meeting_in_clt**; also aligns to signal interpretation needs in **81222_call_with_b_braun**).
7. **Clarify commercial path post-pilot**: document which investment decisions are explicitly deferred vs contingent on pilot success (given the stated “not ready for add-ons” posture) (Docs: **re_confirmed_bbraun_mi_demo_virtual**, **market_insights_b_braun_jan_2026**, **market_insights_b_braun_nov_2025**).
