## 1) Executive Summary (6–10 bullets)

- The document is an email thread coordinating a **Market Insights pitch to B. Braun** and preparation of a **shared slide deck**.
- **Sachin Shah** confirmed the plan to **reuse the deck presented to JnJ** as the **foundation** for the B. Braun presentation, with revisions needed because content still references JnJ.
- The team was instructed to **add their sections directly** into the shared file: **“Market Insights - B Braun - Nov 2025.pptx”**.
- The **Performance Groups (PG) team** requested to **own their slide section**; others should **coordinate/tag PG contacts** before adding to PG slides.
- **Audrey Siepiela** reviewed the PG slides and **did not add content**, stating additional screenshots felt unnecessary given B. Braun has “**a few somewhat active users**,” beyond what’s already in the “conversion explorer” slide.
- A Microsoft Teams prep meeting originally scheduled **Oct 24, 2025** was **moved back by a week** per Anita’s email; the **new date/time is not provided**.
- Contract summary details were included (e.g., **29 active contracts**, **4 SP and 4 AD**, and two named offerings with dollar amounts).

## 2) Meeting Context

- **Purpose:** Internal coordination and deck-building for a **Market Insights pitch to B. Braun**.
- **Primary artifact:** Shared PowerPoint file **“Market Insights - B Braun - Nov 2025.pptx”**.
- **Working approach:** Start from the **JnJ pitch deck** and revise for B. Braun.
- **Prep meeting:** Microsoft Teams meeting originally set for **Oct 24, 2025**, later moved back one week (exact rescheduled date/time **unknown**).

---

## 3) Key Decisions / Confirmations

- **Deck foundation confirmed:** Sachin will “**reuse the deck we presented to JnJ last week as the foundation** for our B. Braun presentation.”
- **PG slide ownership confirmed:** “**The PG team really wants to own their section of the slides**.”
- **PG content decision confirmed:** Audrey decided **not to add more PG screenshots**, since B. Braun has “**a few somewhat active users**” and additional screenshots seemed unnecessary beyond the existing “conversion explorer” slide.

---

## 4) Open Questions / Follow-ups

- **Deck framework ETA:** TiYany Hughes asked to confirm whether there is an **ETA on the deck framework** (status/answer not included).
- **PG slide completeness:** Matt asked Audrey to flag any gaps if the PG team “**missed anything**” (final status: Audrey reported no additions needed; whether gaps remain is **unknown**).
- **Rescheduled prep meeting details:** The meeting was moved back by a week, but the **new date/time is unknown**.

---

## 5) Risks / Dependencies

- **Content accuracy risk:** Reusing the JnJ deck means **JnJ references must be thoroughly revised** to avoid incorrect client-facing content.
- **Editing/coordination dependency:** The PG team wants to **own their slide section**, so progress depends on **proper coordination** (tagging/reaching out to TiYany/PG contacts before edits).
- **Scheduling dependency:** Prep meeting was moved; lack of a clearly stated new time in the thread creates a **coordination risk**.
- **Evidence depth risk (PG examples):** Decision not to add more PG screenshots may limit supporting visuals if stakeholders later expect more product usage proof (exact expectation **unknown**).

## 6) Suggested Next-Step Email (short draft)

Subject: B. Braun Market Insights Deck — updates, owners, and timing

Hi team,  
Quick recap on the B. Braun deck:

- Sachin is using last week’s **JnJ deck as the foundation** and is revising sections that still reference JnJ.  
- Please add your sections directly into **“Market Insights - B Braun - Nov 2025.pptx.”**  
- Reminder: the **PG team owns the PG slide section**—please tag PG contacts / reach out to **TiYany** before making changes there. Audrey reviewed PG and didn’t add additional screenshots (beyond the current “conversion explorer” slide).

Two quick asks:  
1) Do we have an **ETA for the deck framework** version everyone should build from?  
2) Can someone confirm the **updated Teams prep meeting date/time** (moved one week from Oct 24 per Anita)?

Thanks,  
[Your Name]
