## 1) Executive Summary (6–10 bullets)

- The team aligned to expand the custom IV analytics service from an initial **IV fluids** focus to a **holistic IV therapy market analysis** driven by client feedback.
- Client feedback indicated **less interest in IV fluids** and greater emphasis on the “**triple play**” (bag, tubing, catheter) because it is viewed as **more profitable and strategically important** (per notes).
- “Triple play” was clarified as broader than three items: it was described as encompassing **five IV therapy categories** (and potentially a **sixth**)—final count **not yet finalized**.
- The intended analysis is **cross-category**, aimed at identifying **market gaps, strengths, and weaknesses**, rather than treating categories independently.
- A proposed deliverable is **blinded facility-level market share** views using **three-digit zip codes** and **anonymized facility numbers** to show opportunity without revealing facility identities.
- Identity disclosure constraints were noted due to **national GPO rules**; obtaining member permission to reveal identities is **not scalable** at large facility counts.
- The team discussed leveraging purchase history to infer **aging IV pump fleets** and identify capital cycle opportunities; Premier can track pump purchases over the past **seven years** and suppliers generally report pump sales to Premier (per notes).
- A **DEHP-free product filter** was requested by the client; the team confirmed a **DEHP flag exists in PIM** and expects it to be accurate for solutions and relevant to tubings (validation pending).
- **Pricing and packaging remain unresolved**, with options ranging from maintaining the prior **$250K** level to a larger multi-category engagement (examples discussed but not agreed).

---

## 2) Meeting Context

- Discussion centered on reshaping a **custom analytic service for the IV market** based on client input.
- The original service emphasis on **IV fluids** was reconsidered due to client interest shifting toward the broader IV therapy ecosystem (“triple play” and beyond).
- The group explored scope, deliverables (including anonymized facility-level views), feasibility items (DEHP flagging, pump fleet insights), and commercial packaging/pricing.

---

## 3) Key Decisions / Confirmations

- **Scope direction confirmed (high level):** pursue a **holistic IV market analysis across five/six categories**, rather than a single-category (fluids-only) approach.
- **DEHP-free filtering confirmed feasible:** the **DEHP flag exists in the item master (PIM)** and is expected to be accurate for solutions and relevant to tubings (pending validation).
- **Pump data confirmation (per notes):** pump sales are generally reported by suppliers to Premier, enabling cross-checks between ERP transactions and supplier-reported contract sales.

---

## 4) Open Questions / Follow-ups

- **Final scope definition:** confirm whether the offering covers **five categories vs. six** (fluids/bag-based drugs, TPN macronutrients, etc., plus possible inclusion of **safety IV catheters** as a sixth).
- **Pricing / packaging:** determine whether to keep the previously shared **$250K** price, increase it, or structure a shorter engagement/pilot; no final decision captured.
- **Deliverable specifics:** beyond the concept and a requested screenshot, the exact format/content of the **blinded facility-level market share** deliverable remains **unknown**.

**Action items captured**
- **Matt:** Provide a **sample view/screenshot** of blinded facility-level market share across IV categories (noted as “using Ron as the selector”) for proposal inclusion.
- **Lindsay:** Pull a report from **PIM and Fusion** to validate **DEHP flag accuracy** for solutions and tubings.
- **Lindsay:** Update the proposal (including potential pricing adjustments), complete internal review Monday, and send to the client **before Thanksgiving**.
- **Matt:** Provide a **sample screenshot** for the proposal (explicitly requested: “Can you give me a screenshot of that?”).

---

## 5) Risks / Dependencies

- **Scope ambiguity (5 vs. 6 categories):** may impact pricing, timeline, data requirements, and how results are presented.
- **Data privacy / disclosure constraints:** national GPO rules limit facility identification; scaling member permission is **not feasible** for thousands of facilities, so the approach depends on **effective anonymization** (3-digit ZIP + blinded IDs).
- **DEHP flag accuracy dependency:** DEHP filtering depends on the reliability of the **PIM DEHP flag**, pending validation via PIM/Fusion reporting.
- **Supplier-reported pump sales as a dependency:** pump fleet insights and validation rely on supplier reporting completeness and alignment with transactional data (noted as generally available, but specifics are **unknown**).
- **Deliverable clarity risk:** without an agreed template for the blinded market share views, the client’s expectations may diverge from what is delivered.

## 6) Suggested Next-Step Email (short draft)

Subject: IV Analytics Scope Update + Next Materials (DEHP + Blinded Share View)

Hi [Client Name],  
Following our discussion, we’re aligned on expanding the IV analytics work from a fluids-only view to a **holistic IV therapy market analysis across all relevant categories** (final confirmation pending on whether this is **five vs. six** categories, including potential inclusion of safety IV catheters).

Next steps on our side:
- We will share a **sample/screenshot** of the proposed **blinded facility-level market share** view (3-digit ZIP + anonymized facility IDs) to illustrate the output.  
- We are validating the **DEHP flag in PIM** (via PIM + Fusion reporting) to support a **DEHP-free filter** in the analysis.  
- We will update and send the revised proposal (including options for engagement structure/pricing) **before Thanksgiving**.

Could you please confirm whether you want the scope to include the **sixth category (safety IV catheters)**, or keep to the original five categories?

Best,  
[Your Name]
