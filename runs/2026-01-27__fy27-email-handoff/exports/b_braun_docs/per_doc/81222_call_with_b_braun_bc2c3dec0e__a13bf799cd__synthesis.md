## 1) Executive Summary (6–10 bullets)

- The client wants a **unit forecast at the product family + monthly level** (not SKU level).
- The forecast is intended to help **B. Braun plan needs for shared components**.
- Product-family forecasting is viewed as **“likely more accurate than SKU level”** and expected to **create “less nervousness”** in B. Braun’s planning system (SKU-level variability can be partially handled via **safety stocks**).
- The client values **interpreting supply chain “signals”** (e.g., competitors falling behind on orders; hospitals having recently received a lot of supply) and **needs help interpreting the data**, implying a potential **service/consulting component**.
- A major operational challenge is **keeping up with rapid changes in product mix**, which have **“greatly accelerated.”**
- They are trying to anticipate demand shifts: **when high demand will fall off** and **where demand is about to spike**.
- There are **raw material lead-time constraints** (“Some raw materials have long lead times.”).
- Their relationship with **“Karen & Premier”** is valuable for insight into **hospital dynamics and industry themes**.

## 2) Meeting Context

Discussion focused on improving demand planning for B. Braun by producing a **monthly, product-family-level unit forecast** that supports planning for **shared components** and helps interpret broader **supply chain signals**. The client emphasized increased volatility in **product mix changes**, a need to predict upcoming demand inflections, and constraints from **long raw-material lead times**. They also noted that external insight (via **Karen & Premier**) helps contextualize what is happening in hospitals and the broader industry.

## 3) Key Decisions / Confirmations

- **Forecast granularity preference confirmed:** **Product family + month** level (rather than SKU level).
  - Decision status beyond stated preference/confirmation: **unknown**.

---

## 4) Open Questions / Follow-ups

- How can the forecast help answer:
  - **“When will high demand will fall off?”**
  - **“Where is demand about to spike?”**
- What specific **supply chain signals data** is available (sources, fields, refresh cadence), and what interpretation framework is desired (details **unknown**).
- What is the defined **product family structure** and mapping (details **unknown**).
- Forecast usage details for **shared components** (how component demand is derived/linked) are **unknown**.
- Ownership, timeline, and delivery format for the forecast and “signals interpretation” support are **unknown**.

---

## 5) Risks / Dependencies

- **Long lead-time raw materials** may limit the ability to respond quickly even if demand spikes are identified.
- **Accelerating product-mix changes** may reduce forecast stability and increase the need for frequent recalibration.
- The value of “signals” analysis depends on **data availability and interpretability** (what signals exist and how reliably they reflect real demand is **unknown**).
- Reliance on external context (e.g., **Karen & Premier insights**) may be a dependency for interpreting hospital/industry dynamics.

## 6) Suggested Next-Step Email (short draft)

Subject: Next steps on product-family monthly unit forecasting + supply chain signal interpretation

Hi [Name],  
Thanks for the discussion. To align with your planning needs for shared components, we captured the preference for a **unit forecast at the product family, monthly level** (vs. SKU level), and the opportunity to support **interpretation of supply chain “signals”** to anticipate where demand may spike or fall off.

To proceed, could you confirm:
1) The **product family definitions/mapping** you want used  
2) The **supply chain signals data** you have available (source(s), fields, and refresh cadence)  
3) Any preferred **forecast delivery format** and timing

Once we have that, we can propose the initial forecast output and a lightweight approach for signals interpretation (potential service/consulting component).

Best,  
[Your Name]
