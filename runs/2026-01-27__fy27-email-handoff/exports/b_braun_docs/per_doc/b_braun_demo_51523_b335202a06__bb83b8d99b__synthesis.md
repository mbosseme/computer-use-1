## 1) Executive Summary (6–10 bullets)

- A B. Braun demo took place on **5/15/23** (timestamp noted: **10:03 AM**).
- Attendees represented **Marketing, Supply Planning (S&OP), Contracting, Demand Planning, Channel Management, Sales Operations, and Sales**.
- The group emphasized the importance of **visibility into service levels and trends**.
- They can currently see **service levels to distributors**, but **lack visibility into distributors’ service levels to health systems**.
- “Pain control - market leader” was noted, but the **specific product/category is not defined** in the notes.
- Channel management highlighted long-standing challenges: **“been dealing with shortages for 10 years.”**
- Sales Operations described work providing visibility into the **post-manufacturing supply chain**, including coordination with **HIRC** on **SRS** to identify disruptions (**definitions/scope unknown**).
- A follow-up item labeled **“Intracan - follow up”** was captured, but **topic/owner/timeline are unknown**.

## 2) Meeting Context

- **Event:** “B. Braun Demo 5/15/23”
- **Participants / roles:**
  - **Peter McGregor** — Marketing  
  - **John Gibbons** — Corporate supply planning; manages supply planning (SOP); works with plants  
  - **Bill Miller** — Contracting; manages Premier relationship  
  - **Jennifer Jordan** — Demand planning  
  - **Len Bridgeman** — Channel management; cross-functional; noted ongoing shortages for 10 years  
  - **Jeremy How** — Sales Operations; visibility into post-manufacturing supply chain; works with HIRC on SRS to identify disruptions  
  - **Carmel Veron** — Sales
- **Core theme:** The discussion focused on what “resonated,” especially **service-level visibility** and **trend tracking**.

---

## 3) Key Decisions / Confirmations

- **No explicit decisions were documented** in the provided notes.
- Confirmed themes/needs captured as “what resonated”:
  - Visibility into **customer-experienced service levels** (“which is the most important”).
  - Ability to see **how things are trending**.
  - Current limitation: visibility stops at **distributor service levels**, not distributor-to-health-system performance.

---

## 4) Open Questions / Follow-ups

- **Intracan – follow up:** What is the specific topic, who owns it, and what is the expected timeline? (**unknown**)
- **HIRC:** What does HIRC stand for, and what is its role/scope in this workflow? (**unknown**)
- **SRS:** What does SRS stand for, and how is it used to identify supply chain disruptions? (**unknown**)
- **“Pain control - market leader”:** Which product line/category does this refer to? (**unknown**)

---

## 5) Risks / Dependencies

- **Visibility gap risk:** Inability to see **distributor-to-health-system service levels** may limit accurate end-customer performance insights and corrective action prioritization.
- **Supply continuity risk:** The organization has **“been dealing with shortages for 10 years,”** indicating persistent supply constraints that may continue to affect service levels.
- **Dependency on undefined processes/teams:** Effective disruption identification appears tied to **HIRC/SRS**, but their definitions and scope are **not documented** in the notes.

Subject: Follow-ups from B. Braun Demo (5/15)

Hi all,  
Thanks for the discussion during the 5/15 B. Braun demo. Key takeaway was the value of service-level visibility and trend tracking—especially the gap between our visibility to distributors vs. distributors’ service levels to health systems.

To close out next steps, could we please confirm:
- What “Intracan – follow up” refers to, and assign an owner + target date  
- Definitions/scope for HIRC and SRS (and how they’re used to identify supply chain disruptions)  
- What product/category is referenced by “Pain control – market leader”

Thanks,  
[Your Name]
