## 2) Meeting Context

- **Meeting title:** Prep for Market Insights Pitch to B. Braun  
- **Platform:** Microsoft Teams  
- **Objective (verbatim intent):**
  - “Setting this prep time to discuss B Braun as a team”
  - “finalize which key areas to highlight when pitching MI to B. Braun”
- **Schedule note:** Meeting moved back by a week (per Anita’s email); **new time: 10/24/2025 at 11:00 AM**.

---

## 3) Key Decisions / Confirmations

- **Confirmed schedule change:** Meeting **moved back by one week**; updated meeting time listed as **10/24/2025, 11:00 AM**.
- No other decisions are explicitly captured in the provided notes (unknown).

---

## 4) Open Questions / Follow-ups

- What are the **specific “key areas to highlight”** in the MI pitch to B. Braun? (not specified)
- What exactly do **“Surpass”** and **“AscenDrive”** refer to in this context (products, programs, contracts, etc.)? (unknown)
- Can we obtain the **full breakdown of the “29 active contracts”** beyond the two examples listed? (unknown)
- Clarify what **“SP”** and **“AD”** stand for in the contract summary (unknown if not standard internally).

---

## 5) Risks / Dependencies

- **Pitch readiness dependency:** The team must align on the **key MI areas to emphasize**; without this, messaging may be inconsistent.
- **Data completeness risk:** The contract summary references **29 active contracts** but only provides **two examples**, limiting the ability to tailor the pitch without additional detail.
- **Ambiguity risk:** Unexplained references (**Surpass**, **AscenDrive**, and potentially **SP/AD**) could cause confusion or gaps in preparation unless clarified.
