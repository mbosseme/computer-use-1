## 1) Executive Summary (6–10 bullets)

- B. Braun and the Market Insights team met on **11/3/2025 (1:00 PM)** in **CLT** (with Teams option) to discuss **Market Insights / supply chain tech data** capabilities.
- **Compliance—especially for IV/IV-therapy—was confirmed as the #1 priority**, with **patient safety** as the other core focus.
- B. Braun wants **National-program compliance visibility** because **IV/IV-therapy is a National-only agreement** (not limited to SURPASS/AscenDrive).
- The team discussed enabling **proactive disruption management** (e.g., hurricane-type events) via a **“live view”** and **shortage radar** for market changes by SKU and switching behavior.
- Proposed analytics included: **IV Solutions forecasting (8–10 weeks)**, **safety IV catheter targeting & post-conversion leakage monitoring**, **NRFit adoption mapping**, **distributor SLA monitoring**, and **program performance/compliance watchlists**.
- There is a known constraint: it is **hard for B. Braun to obtain hospital data directly**; approaches discussed included **member-permission sharing (“Lindsay’s form”)** and **modeled “expected spend”** where permission isn’t available.
- **Purchase confirmed:** Bill confirmed **~$150K** for **two Performance Group (PG) data contracts** (one data-only, one data + services).
- Open needs include defining an SOW for **National (esp. IV) compliance**, clarifying **non-acute segmentation (OLM vs. independent)**, and assessing feasibility of **linking compliance (e.g., DEHP-free conversion) to clinical outcomes**.
- Stakeholder expansion was suggested: **Phil** proposed involving additional sales/marketing content owners and is open to an **in-person executive session in Allentown, PA** (date/attendees unknown).

## 2) Meeting Context

- **Meeting name:** “BBraun Market Insights Meeting in CLT”  
- **Date/time:** **11/3/2025, 1:00 PM**  
- **Location:** **CLT-BET-340 (16); 13520 Ballantyne Corporate Pl** (Microsoft Teams option noted)  
- **Purpose:** Discuss **Market Insights (Supply Chain tech data)** with the B. Braun team.  
- **Most engaged attendees (noted):** **Bill Miller, Anita Zado, Tracy Butryn**  
- **Operating cadence context:** B. Braun operates on a **calendar fiscal year (new FY begins January)**; reporting/timing should align to that cadence.  
- **Current tooling/data context:** B. Braun uses **IQVIA data delivered in Power BI**.

---

## 3) Key Decisions / Confirmations

- **Purchase confirmed:** Bill confirmed paying **~$150K** for **two Performance Group (PG) data contracts** — **one data-only** and **one data + services**.
- **Priority confirmed:** **Compliance is the #1 priority** (across Bill/Anita/Tracy), particularly for **IV/IV-therapy**; **patient safety** is also a central focus.
- **Data-sharing approach acknowledged:**  
  - **With member permission (via “Lindsay’s form”)**: share **actual compliance view**.  
  - **Without permission**: use modeled **“expected spend”** to infer compliance vs. actual sales.
- **Program scope emphasis confirmed:** Need for **National compliance visibility**, given **IV/IV-therapy is a National-only agreement**.

---

## 4) Open Questions / Follow-ups

- **National compliance SOW definition (esp. IV):** How exactly to **“triangulate gaps”** and **measure typical volume by hospital type**; timeline/owners **unknown**.
- **Current disruption “live view”:** What specific disruption scenario is being referenced and what data/view is needed for the “live” workflow; timing/owner **unknown**.
- **Outcomes linkage feasibility:** Can compliance be linked to clinical outcomes (e.g., **DEHP-free conversion** vs. non-converted peers); feasibility/scope **unknown**.
- **Marketing proof points:** Whether MI can produce outcome/practice benefit narratives for highly compliant IV solutions portfolios (beyond targeting); deliverable definition **unknown**.
- **Non-acute segmentation:** Definitions and data availability for **“OLM vs. independent split in non-acute”** are **unknown**.
- **Stakeholder expansion / Allentown session:** Date, attendee list, and goals for the proposed in-person executive session are **unknown**.
- **Proposal request:** Need a **proposal on PG (including services) across all PG categories**; owner/timeline **unknown**.

---

## 5) Risks / Dependencies

- **Hospital-level visibility dependency:** Actual compliance reporting may depend on **member permission**; otherwise analyses rely on **modeled expected spend**, which may limit precision/acceptance for certain use cases.
- **Outcome linkage risk:** Requests to tie compliance (including DEHP-free conversion) to outcomes may require data access/clinical linkage that is **not confirmed** in the notes.
- **Operational urgency during disruptions:** Delivering a “live view” for an active disruption implies a dependency on timely data refresh/alerting and an agreed escalation workflow (details **unknown**).
- **Scope alignment risk:** National IV compliance needs span beyond existing programs (SURPASS/AscenDrive); unclear scope could delay SOW finalization and rollout.
- **Data integration expectations:** B. Braun already uses **IQVIA in Power BI**; alignment with MI exports/dashboards and QBR workflows is a dependency (specific integration plan **unknown**).

## 6) Suggested Next-Step Email (short draft)

Subject: Next steps from BBraun Market Insights meeting (Compliance / IV National)

Hi Bill/Anita/Tracy (and team),  

Thank you for the discussion on 11/3 in CLT. We captured **compliance (especially IV/IV-therapy National)** as the top priority, with patient safety as a key focus, along with interest in **proactive disruption visibility (“live view”)**.

Proposed next steps:
1) Share a **proposal for PG (including services) across all PG categories** (owner/timing TBD).  
2) Schedule a working session to **scope the National (esp. IV) compliance SOW**, including how we’ll **triangulate gaps** and **measure typical volume by hospital type**.  
3) Confirm the path for hospital-level visibility: **member permission via “Lindsay’s form”** vs. **modeled expected spend** where permission isn’t available.  
4) If helpful, identify stakeholders for a follow-up session (Phil mentioned expanding to sales/marketing content owners and an optional in-person session in **Allentown, PA**).

Please let us know who should own each item and your preferred timing, especially given your **calendar FY starting in January**.  

Best,
