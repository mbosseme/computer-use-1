## 1) Executive Summary (6–10 bullets)

- The document (Premier Inc. – Market Insights / Data & Analytics, Jan 2026) outlines **Premier Market Insights (PMI)** data products and a **recommended partnership with B. Braun** (decision status **unknown** in provided text).
- PMI’s data source combines **PO, invoice, inventory, cross-reference, and master data** and is positioned as representing the **U.S. acute care market**, delivered via a **customized dashboard** with **daily data updates**.
- The proposed PMI use cases focus on “**Grow Revenue and Maximize Margin**” across **contract performance**, **segmentation/targeting**, **market expansion**, **supply chain resiliency/demand forecasting**, and **channel partner management** (e.g., distributor substitutions, SLAs).
- Contract-performance insights highlight **Safety IV Catheter** as a priority (incumbent dual-awarded supplier leaving the market; alternate supplier activated **10/1**; volume risk), and flag **Regional Anesthesia Trays** as complex due to **custom tray exclusions**.
- Portfolio snapshot (Premier-only acute care) shows B. Braun at **$299M revenue (+18.5% YoY)** vs. **$1.7B market (+13.6% YoY)**, with **17.6% share (up from 16.8%)**.
- Category signals include: **Safety IV Catheters** (B. Braun **+0.8%** vs market **-1.6%**) and **IV Therapy – Infusion Devices** (B. Braun **+4.1%** vs market **+10.9%**).
- Supply chain indicators note **higher past-due PO line rates vs competition** for B. Braun, while **competitor backorders/cancellations spiked late 2024** and B. Braun remained **lower**; a custom **Shortage Condition Score** is referenced, with **Baxter products projected highest shortage risk**.
- A disruption labeled “Helene” is referenced: hospital usage fell sharply post-disruption and remains below pre-levels; days of supply peaked at **~33 (~2.2x)** and remains **~1.3x** elevated; purchasing suppression noted (**Q2 ’25: 8 days / ~8%**, **Q3 ’25: 5 days / ~5%**).
- Proposed deliverables include a **name-blind market share map** across **6 IV categories** (noted as a **6-month engagement**) and a **zip-3 mapped Target Action List** for sales deployment, including identifying **50 “Whale” accounts** with significant upside.
- Investment figures are listed (continuing and new), but **approval/selection is unknown**: **$175k/year (current continues)**, **$165k/year (new; co-term with GPO contracts)**, and **$250k for a 6-month custom analytics services engagement**.

## 2) Meeting Context

- Context appears to be an internal/external working session or proposal review covering:
  - PMI product capabilities, data coverage claims, and dashboard delivery model.
  - A **recommended partnership** structure for **B. Braun** tied to Premier/GPO contracting needs.
  - Priority categories for contract performance and growth targeting.
  - Supply chain resiliency and shortage-risk monitoring concepts.
- Specific meeting attendees, date/time, and explicit approvals are **unknown** based on provided text.

## 3) Key Decisions / Confirmations

- **No explicit decisions or approvals are recorded** in the provided chunk summary (slides reference “Recommended… Partnership” and “Next Steps?” but do not capture a confirmed outcome).
- Confirmed (as presented in the document):
  - PMI integrates **PO/invoice/inventory/cross-reference/master data** and provides **daily data updates** via a **customized dashboard**.
  - Priority focus areas include **Safety IV Catheter** and **Regional Anesthesia Trays** (with noted complexity/limitations for custom trays).

---

## 4) Open Questions / Follow-ups

- Will B. Braun **approve** the recommended PMI partnership investments/subscriptions? (**unknown**)
- Which investment components will be selected (if any):
  - **$165k/year** “new investment” (co-termed with GPO contracts)
  - **$250k / 6-month** IV categories custom analytics services engagement
  - Optional add-ons: **Capital Refresh Recency** and/or **DEHP/PVC-Free Targets** (selection **unknown**)
- What is the scope, timeline, and success criteria for the “Potential Next Steps / Next Steps?” sections (details **unknown**; headings only referenced)?
- Ownership and resourcing for deliverables (market share map, target action list) are implied to be Premier/PMI but **not explicitly assigned**—confirm responsible parties and milestones.

---

## 5) Risks / Dependencies

- **Data/coverage dependency:** Insights rely on PMI’s combined datasets and claimed acute-care representation; any gaps in feed completeness, mapping/cross-references, or refresh cadence could affect outputs (validation steps **unknown**).
- **Contract/category dependency:** Safety IV Catheter dynamics depend on market changes (incumbent dual-awarded supplier exiting; alternate supplier activation on **10/1**) that may shift volumes and competitive positioning.
- **Operational/supply chain risk:** Despite lower competitor backorders/cancellations relative to late-2024 spikes, B. Braun is described as having **higher past-due PO line rates than competition**; this could affect customer satisfaction and growth efforts.
- **External disruption sensitivity:** Post-“Helene” purchasing suppression and elevated days-of-supply signals suggest demand patterns may be distorted; forecasts/targets may require normalization assumptions (approach **unknown**).
- **Decision/timing risk:** Partnership recommendations and “next steps” are not confirmed; value realization depends on securing approvals and aligning to GPO contract co-term timing.

Subject: Confirming PMI Partnership Scope, Investments, and Next-Step Deliverables

Hi [Name],  
Thank you for reviewing Premier Market Insights’ recommended partnership approach for B. Braun. To finalize next steps, could you please confirm:

1) Whether you’d like to proceed with the proposed investments (current $175k/year continuation; $165k/year new co-termed investment; and/or the $250k 6-month custom analytics engagement for 6 IV categories).  
2) Whether you want to include the optional add-ons (Capital Refresh Recency and/or DEHP/PVC-Free Targets).  
3) Your preferred timing and primary stakeholders for delivering the name-blind market share map (acute; 6 IV categories) and the zip-3 Target Action List for sales deployment (including the 50 “Whale” accounts).

Once confirmed, we can share a draft project plan and timeline aligned to your contracting calendar.
