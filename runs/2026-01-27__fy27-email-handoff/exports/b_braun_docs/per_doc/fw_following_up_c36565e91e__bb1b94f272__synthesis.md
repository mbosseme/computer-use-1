Subject: Scheduling follow-up market data capabilities demo (early 2026)

Hi Tracy and Jen,  
Thank you for the update—and congratulations to Jen on the new leadership role.

Per your request, we’d be happy to schedule a smaller-group follow-up demo focused on Premier’s market data capabilities. Could you share a few dates/times that work in early 2026, or confirm if you prefer that we send availability first?

Also, if there are specific discussion points or questions from the prior session you’d like us to address in the demo, please send them our way so we can tailor the agenda.  
Best regards,  
Anita Mouroutsos
