## 1) Executive Summary (6–10 bullets)

- Premier and B. Braun are aligned that near-term work must be **strictly exploratory**, **very limited**, and **tightly scoped**—**single category**, **facility-level**—and **not** a large-scale engagement.  
- Premier proposed starting with a **small, time-boxed pilot** that includes **clear success criteria** and a **go/no-go decision point**, documented in a small SOW (once scope is agreed).  
- Two potential initial pilot “slice” options were floated:  
  - **IV Ecosystem** single-category facility-level competitor/coverage + opportunity view (e.g., Safety IV Catheters or Infusion Sets/Accessories) using a **de-identified facility cohort (IDs only)** plus supporting documentation.  
  - **CAPS/compounding (503B)** category validation slice (once a SKU list is available), comparing **ERP purchasing vs wholesaler tracings**.  
- Jennifer Gotto (B. Braun) provided a **SKU list** for a **sample data cut** (primarily IV solutions/fluids and related items; includes volumes, SKUs, descriptions, and NDCs).  
- Matt Bossemeyer (Premier) confirmed receipt and stated Premier will start **next week**, providing an **ETA and/or the sample by EOW** (exact week **unknown**, context suggests following Fri Jan 23, 2026).  
- A **30-minute working session** is needed to select and align on the best initial pilot slice and confirm scope (scheduled time **unknown**).  
- B. Braun indicated they are **not ready to consider add-ons** (e.g., “Capital Refresh” or “DEHP/PVC-Free”) at this time; any inclusion remains **unknown** pending scope decisions.

## 2) Meeting Context

- Source is an email thread between **Premier (Matt Bossemeyer)** and **B. Braun (Jennifer Gotto)** (cc: Jake Astarita, Tracy Butryn, and additional Premier team members).  
- Discussion centers on a **B. Braun MI Demo (virtual)** and potential follow-on analytics work.  
- B. Braun reset expectations to limit near-term activity to a **narrow proof-of-concept** rather than broader Custom Analytics Services engagement.

---

## 3) Key Decisions / Confirmations

- **B. Braun confirmation:** Not proceeding toward “a large-scale investment or full engagement” now; only a **narrow, category-specific proof-of-concept** (single category, facility-level).  
- **Premier confirmation:** Will use the provided **SKU list** to create a **sample data cut**, starting **next week**, and will provide an **ETA and/or sample by EOW**.

---

## 4) Open Questions / Follow-ups

- Which initial pilot slice will be selected (IV Ecosystem category vs CAPS/503B validation vs other)? **Unknown**.  
- When will B. Braun deliver the full/updated **CAPS SKU list** (noted as still being gathered)? **Unknown**.  
- Will any add-ons (e.g., “Capital Refresh,” “DEHP/PVC-Free”) be included? Currently not planned; final decision **unknown**.  
- Which proposed meeting time (Jan 20 / Jan 22 options) was chosen for the working session? **Unknown**.  
- What are the agreed **success criteria** and the **go/no-go** decision gate for the pilot SOW? **To be defined** in the working session.

---

## 5) Risks / Dependencies

- **Scope risk:** If the pilot scope expands beyond “single category / facility-level,” it may conflict with B. Braun’s stated constraints.  
- **Data dependency:** CAPS/503B validation path depends on receiving the **CAPS SKU list** (timing unknown).  
- **Scheduling dependency:** Pilot definition and SOW creation depend on completing the **30-minute working session** (date/time unknown).  
- **Timeline risk:** Premier committed to an **EOW ETA/sample**, but the specific week is not explicitly stated in the summary (timing precision **unknown**).

## 6) Suggested Next-Step Email (short draft)

Subject: Next steps: exploratory pilot slice + sample data cut timing

Hi Jennifer,  
Thanks again for sharing the SKU list for the sample data cut. We’ll start on this first thing next week and will send an ETA—if not the sample itself—by EOW.

To keep this strictly exploratory and tightly scoped as discussed, can we confirm a 30-minute working session to align on the initial pilot slice (e.g., single IV Ecosystem category facility-level view vs CAPS/503B validation once the CAPS SKU list is available) and agree on success criteria + a go/no-go decision point for a small SOW?

Also, please let us know timing for the CAPS SKU list when your team has it.

Best,  
Matt Bossemeyer
