## 1) Executive Summary (6–10 bullets)

- Initial engagement showed strong interest, especially from Carmel (VP Sales), but momentum stalled when Jennifer (demand planner) went out on leave; there is a good opportunity to re-engage.
- The team discussed demand-planning pain points driven by distributor ordering (lumpy demand) and limited visibility to hospital point-of-sale (“blind to the ‘Point of Sale’”).
- Current forecasting outputs are monthly and then “divided evenly across weeks”; stakeholders indicated an “8–10 week forecast window is ideal,” and they “typically keep safety stock of 5 weeks.”
- Marketing/sales want better insight into large, aged orders (e.g., a “large order… sitting out there for 90 days”) and whether hospitals have switched to alternates—and how long they stay switched.
- Practice/physician-driven mix changes can undermine forecasts (e.g., physician preference changes and the supplier not being notified).
- Proposed/confirmed next step: do a deep dive in one category (regional anesthesia—epidurals) and present the data in the format Jennifer would actually receive.
- Confirmed forecasting scope target: forecast at month level, 3 months out; attempt both group-level and SKU-level if time allows.
- Data rights/permissions were raised as a concern (Alan): whether hospitals have granted rights to use the data.
- Sales emphasized the need for SKU-level visibility “if possible” and noted allocation/restriction behaviors to protect current customers during supply constraints.

## 2) Meeting Context

- Participants referenced: Carmel (VP Sales), Jennifer (demand planner; currently/previously on leave), Alan (raised data rights concern), plus marketing/sales/demand planning stakeholders (specific names/roles otherwise unknown).
- Discussion focused on forecasting and demand planning process inputs, desired forecast windows, and how to handle distributor-driven demand volatility—especially in pain control / regional anesthesia.
- The conversation also covered commercial questions (aged orders, hospital switching behavior) and operational constraints (allocation/restriction to protect customers).

## 3) Key Decisions / Confirmations

- **Deep-dive approach confirmed:** “dive deeply into a single category (regional anesthesia – epidurals), show the data that Jennifer would actually receive.”
- **Forecast scope confirmed:** “forecast at month level for 3 months out.”
- **If time allows:** attempt outputs for “whole group as well as individual SKU level.”

---

## 4) Open Questions / Follow-ups

- Is the “large order… sitting out there for 90 days” still needed?
- Has the hospital already received an alternate supply?
- When hospitals switch to an alternative, how long do they stay with it before switching back?
- Data rights: “Have the hospitals given you rights to use this data?”
- Clarify unclear statement from notes: “they current ramp up fast enough” (meaning unknown / needs confirmation).
- Confirm ownership/availability for the next deep-dive session given Jennifer’s leave status (timing/owner unknown).

---

## 5) Risks / Dependencies

- **Key-person dependency:** progress previously slowed because Jennifer (demand planner) went out on leave.
- **Data rights/legal dependency:** ability to use hospital-related data depends on whether hospitals have granted rights (raised explicitly by Alan).
- **Data/visibility limitation:** distributor-driven demand is “lumpy” and the team is “blind to the ‘Point of Sale’,” which may limit forecast accuracy and early warning signals.
- **Behavioral/market dynamics risk:** physician preference and practice changes can shift mix without notification, degrading forecast performance.
- **Data/output fit:** stakeholders prefer “raw data in excel” and want the deep-dive to mirror what Jennifer actually consumes; misalignment could reduce adoption.

## 6) Suggested Next-Step Email (short draft)

Subject: Next steps: Regional anesthesia deep dive + 3-month forecast outputs

Hi team,  
Per our discussion, the proposed next step is to **deep dive into regional anesthesia (epidurals)** and **share the data in the same format Jennifer would receive**, alongside a **month-level forecast for 3 months out** (and SKU-level views where time allows).

A few quick follow-ups to unblock this:
- Carmel: can you **send the list of all SKUs** (and confirm which are top volume to prioritize)?
- Alan/Team: can we confirm **data rights/permissions** (i.e., whether hospitals have granted rights to use this data)?
- Also, we’d like to clarify the status of the **90-day open large order** (still needed? alternate supply already received?).

Please share availability for a working session to review the epidurals category dataset and outputs.

Thanks,  
[Your Name]
