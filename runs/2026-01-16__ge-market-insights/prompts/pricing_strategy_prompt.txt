# Pricing Strategy Analysis Prompt

**Role:** You are a Senior Engagement Manager at a Healthcare Data Consultancy. You are pricing a Pilot SOW for a major MedTech client (GE Healthcare).

**Context:** 
The client wants "Market Share" visibility. We have a unique proprietary dataset (Premier Inc. Transaction Data) covering ~45% of U.S. hospital spend. 
- **The Client's Alternative:** Buying aggregated data from definitive/GHX (expensive, often lagged) or relying on their own sales data (blind to competitors).
- **The Value Prop:** We have actual ERP extract data (SKU-level price/quantity) for acute care.
- **The Challenge:** The client is fixated on "PO vs Invoice" timing because their internal revenue recognition is complex. We are offering a "Core" MVP that uses our standard data, plus expensive "Add-ons" to do the complex custom work.

**Input - The SOW (Scope of Work):**

# Statement of Work: GE Healthcare Market Insights Pilot

**Client:** GE Healthcare  
**Project:** Market Share Intelligence Dashboard
**Date:** January 23, 2026

## 2. Engagement Options & Scope

### 2.1. Core Scope: Acute Care Market Intelligence (MVP)
*Objective: Deliver immediate visibility into GE’s competitive position within the Acute Care hospital market using existing, high-fidelity provider transaction data, calibrated against supplier-reported totals.*
*   **Data Source:** Premier Provider Transaction Data (Acute Care ERP Extract).
*   **Driver Analysis:** Share vs. Mix Logic (Automated decomposition of variance).
*   **"Dual Signal" Calibration:** Overlay view comparing Transaction Data trend (Leading Indicator) against Supplier-Reported Sales trend.
*   **Interactive Dashboard Views:** Trend Analysis (Rolling 12), Geographic Drill-down (3-Digit Zip), Competitive View (Category/Manufacturer).

### 2.2. Optional Add-On 1: Non-Acute Market Expansion
*Objective: Extend visibility beyond the hospital into Imaging Centers, Surgery Centers (ASCs), and Clinics.*
*   **Data Strategy:** Blends Manufacturer-Reported Sales Tracings.
*   **Limitations:** ~2-4 month reporting lag. Competitive views restricted to "GE vs. Rest of Market."

### 2.3. Optional Add-On 2: Deep Dive: Capital Cycle Timing Analysis (PO vs. Invoice)
*Objective: Conduct a focused study on the specific timing intervals between Purchase Order and Invoice.*
*   **Methodology:** Isolate "Pure PO" and "Pure Invoice" data streams from a sub-sample of members. Analyze timing lag for Major Capital categories.  
*   **Deliverable:** Static analysis and comparative trend lines.

**Task:**
Estimate the Fair Market Value (Fixed Fee) for these options.
Consider:
1.  **Pilot Pricing Strategy:** We want them to buy Option A (Core) quickly. It should feel like a "No Brainer" to get started.
2.  **Add-on Pricing:** Option B (Non-Acute) is moderate effort. Option C (PO/Invoice Study) is high effort and niche value—we want to price this primarily to deter them from picking it unless they *really* need it (or to make Option A look like a bargain).
3.  **Market Rates:** For custom analytics dashboards in the US Healthcare Enterprise space.

**Output:**
Provide a pricing recommendation in the format:
*   **Option A Range:** $X - $Y
*   **Option B Range:** +$X - $Y
*   **Option C Range:** +$X - $Y
*   **Rationale:** Brief explanation for each price point.
