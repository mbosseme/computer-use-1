Subject: Touching Base — Mid-January Follow-Up

Hi Caroline,

I hope you had a wonderful Christmas and New Year!

I wanted to follow up as planned and reconnect to see where things stand on your end—particularly any updates on the budgeting process—and to check in on your current needs and potential partnership opportunities going forward.

Would you be open to a 30–45 minute call at one of the times below (EST)?
- Friday, Jan 23: 9:30 AM or 12:00 PM
- Monday, Jan 26: 9:30 AM or 1:30 PM
- Tuesday, Jan 27: 12:00 PM or 3:00 PM

If none of these work, feel free to share a couple of alternatives and I’ll do my best to accommodate.

Best regards,
Matthew Bossemeyer
