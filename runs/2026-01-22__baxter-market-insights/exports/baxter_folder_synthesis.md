## Executive Summary (8–12 bullets)

- Across the Baxter-focused materials, Premier positions **Market Insights (MI)** and related **Digital Supply Chain (DSC)** capabilities as **data-driven platforms aligning supply chain + clinical data** to enable **manufacturer growth** (e.g., targeting, contract performance, resiliency, forecasting, expansion). (Docs: *Detailed Briefing Document…*, *Market Insights – Baxter – Jun/Jul 2025*, *Market Insights – Baxter – Proposal – Jun 2025*, *Digital Supply Chain Message Map*)
- A repeated, foundational capability is **linking clinical charge/encounter data to supply chain purchasing/item master/inventory data** via cleansing/matching to create **brand/device-level utilization and “true cost per case”** insights—especially important outside the OR where device specificity is often missing. (Docs: *Identifying Specific Medical Devices…*, *Market Insights – Baxter – Jun/Jul 2025*)
- Baxter-specific examples center on **Surgical Hemostatics** (e.g., growth/share views and a stated opportunity to increase **PERCLOT** share in **absorbable powders**; portfolio gap callouts like **sheets/sponges**), plus **IV fluids disruption** dynamics and recovery behavior. (Docs: *Market Insights – Baxter – Jun 2025*, *Market Insights – Baxter – Jul 2025*)
- The **June 2025 Baxter proposal** frames a packaged offering (DATA + INSIGHTS + CUSTOM ANALYSIS + ONGOING SUPPORT), with delivery via **dashboards and/or direct data feeds**, plus collaboration cadence; it also includes commercial/contract structural notes affecting existing MSAs. (Doc: *Market Insights – Baxter – Proposal – Jun 2025*)
- Several items remain **definition-/data-model constrained**, including **account definition/grouping**, potential **lot/serial integration**, and other modeling dimensions (e.g., rep territories)—which are prerequisites for consistent segmentation and analytics. (Doc: *Detailed Briefing Document…*)
- There is explicit **organizational dependency and sponsorship risk** in advancing “market expansion and targeting” work for **Hill ROM IV and Advanced Surgery**, with notes that credibility/escalation pathways may be misaligned. (Doc: *Baxter IV & Legacy Hill Rom*)
- A recurring operational friction is **data accessibility/governance**, with HEOR described as controlling data stored in **SAS files**, reducing accessibility for other teams. (Doc: *Baxter Background from John House*)
- Execution readiness issues appear across documents: **unclear owners**, **unknown/unstated “next steps”**, and **budget/approval dependencies** (notably in messaging/enablement planning). (Docs: *Baxter Adv. Surg Premier – Market Insights Follow up 71*, *Digital Supply Chain Message Map*, *Market Insights – Baxter – Jun/Jul 2025*)
- A concrete near-term coordination need is to **clarify overlap between “the PHD” and “Baxter Adv. Surg <> Premier”** via follow-up with **Michelle**. (Doc: *Baxter Adv. Surg Premier – Market Insights Follow up 71*)

## Themes (with evidence references)

### 1) “Clinical + Supply Chain” deep-linking as the analytic moat
- Problem: outside the OR, chargemaster/encounter data often lacks sufficient device detail; solution is linking encounter data to PO/item master/inventory to infer manufacturer/brand (often model #). (Doc: *Identifying Specific Medical Devices…*)
- MI decks for Baxter reiterate the same mechanism: matching cleansed facility product descriptions with charge descriptions to assign catalog numbers/product attributes to charge data. (Docs: *Market Insights – Baxter – Jun 2025*, *Market Insights – Baxter – Jul 2025*)
- Strategic implication: this linkage underpins “true cost per case,” utilization insights, and downstream manufacturer use cases (targeting, contract performance, resiliency). (Docs: *Identifying Specific Medical Devices…*, *Detailed Briefing Document…*)

### 2) Growth use cases repeat across deliverables and messaging
- Recurring use case set: **contract performance/compliance**, **segmentation & targeting**, **supply chain resiliency**, **demand forecasting**, **market expansion**, **channel/distributor performance management**. (Docs: *Detailed Briefing Document…*, *Market Insights – Baxter – Jun/Jul 2025*, *Market Insights – Baxter – Proposal – Jun 2025*, *Digital Supply Chain Message Map*)
- The DSC message map also sets explicit pipeline goals (“secure two additional deals in FY25 and three-plus deals in FY26”) tied to supplier-focused positioning. (Doc: *Digital Supply Chain Message Map*)

### 3) Data model / definition readiness is a gating factor
- Internal alignment needs are explicitly called out: **account definitions/groupings**, **lot/serial number integration** feasibility, **rep territory** inclusion, **Rx/503B expansion**, pricing governance, and “Best Modeled Member Definition.” (Doc: *Detailed Briefing Document…*)
- Similar ambiguity shows up in Baxter-facing materials where refresh cadence and some disruption methodology details are not fully specified in the summaries. (Docs: *Market Insights – Baxter – Jun 2025*, *Market Insights – Baxter – Jul 2025*)

### 4) Baxter opportunity framing relies on category-specific narratives (hemostatics + IV fluids)
- Hemostatics: market/share and competitive snapshot plus a stated opportunity to increase **PERCLOT** share in absorbable powders; portfolio gap noted in sheets/sponges with illustrative upside. (Docs: *Market Insights – Baxter – Jun 2025*, *Market Insights – Baxter – Jul 2025*)
- IV fluids: disruption-driven share shifts and subsequent recovery narratives; proposal includes specific “pre-Helene baseline” comparisons and share movement claims. (Docs: *Market Insights – Baxter – Jun 2025*, *Market Insights – Baxter – Proposal – Jun 2025*)

### 5) Enablement and go-to-market planning has dependencies (budget/approval/competitive)
- DSC messaging/content plan depends on **BU approval** and **budget** for tactics marked “pending budget”; competitor sections are incomplete (“XXX”) for several players. (Doc: *Digital Supply Chain Message Map*)
- MI positioning includes a competitive set (Vizient, Truveta, SmartTRAK/BioMed GPS; distributors) and notes IQVIA MDSA is framed as less of a threat for med device DSC (per document). (Doc: *Detailed Briefing Document…*)

### 6) Governance and sponsorship constraints could slow execution
- Data access: HEOR “monopolizing the data” in SAS reduces accessibility to other teams. (Doc: *Baxter Background from John House*)
- Sponsorship/escalation: market expansion/targeting interest exists, but escalation path is unclear; credibility concerns (Caroline) and reliance on someone who can take deals “to the top of the house” (Rory) are noted. (Doc: *Baxter IV & Legacy Hill Rom*)
- Ownership gaps: multiple follow-ups have unknown owners (e.g., overlap question with “the PHD”; various MI internal action items). (Docs: *Baxter Adv. Surg Premier – Market Insights Follow up 71*, *Detailed Briefing Document…*)

## Notable Decisions / Confirmations

- **MI contract-performance scope boundary:** Contract Performance analytics will cover **all current and future Surpass and AscenDrive awarded categories**, **excluding any future Baxter acquisitions**. (Doc: *Market Insights – Baxter – Proposal – Jun 2025*)
- **MSA transition note:** Existing MSAs for **Blood Pressure Cuffs** and **Airway Clearance** would be **terminated when the new agreement starts**. (Doc: *Market Insights – Baxter – Proposal – Jun 2025*)
- **Methodology confirmation (clinical comparability):** Premier’s clinical team groups products/patient cases by **clinical similarity** so comparisons are within comparable cohorts. (Docs: *Market Insights – Baxter – Jun 2025*, *Market Insights – Baxter – Jul 2025*)
- **Methodology confirmation (charge-to-supply linking):** Matching cleansed facility-submitted product descriptions with charge descriptions links charge and supply data, enabling catalog/product attribute assignment. (Docs: *Identifying Specific Medical Devices…*, *Market Insights – Baxter – Jun/Jul 2025*)
- **External sharing constraint:** Slides preceding the appendix may be shared externally; appendix/IP-marked slides may not. (Doc: *Identifying Specific Medical Devices…*)
- **Org/budget structure confirmation:** **IV and Advanced Surgery** roll up to the **same leader and budget**. (Doc: *Baxter IV & Legacy Hill Rom*)

- **Data access/governance:** Which datasets are in scope for the HEOR-controlled SAS files; what change (if any) is intended to improve accessibility; Tyler Wunder’s role/team. (Doc: *Baxter Background from John House*)
- **Baxter commercialization/implementation specifics:** What “next steps” were agreed (owners/dates), which categories are in scope beyond examples, and what refresh cadence applies per deliverable (daily vs other). (Docs: *Market Insights – Baxter – Jun 2025*, *Market Insights – Baxter – Jul 2025*)
- **Disruption methodology transparency:** Baselines, timeframes/geographies, affected SKUs, and definitions for demand/unmet demand/share in IV fluids (and any surgical hemostatics disruption content referenced by title only). (Docs: *Market Insights – Baxter – Jun 2025*, *Market Insights – Baxter – Jul 2025*, *Market Insights – Baxter – Proposal – Jun 2025*)
- **MI platform unresolved model items:** Account definition/grouping; lot/serial integration; rep territories; Rx/503B expansion; pricing governance; “Best Modeled Member Definition.” (Doc: *Detailed Briefing Document…*)
- **DSC GTM readiness:** Which BU approves by April 4, budget status for “pending budget” tactics, Phase 2 timing/content, and completion of competitor sections with placeholders. (Doc: *Digital Supply Chain Message Map*)
- **Sponsorship/escalation for market expansion & targeting:** What “Standard Hypo NPI support” means; what “Legacy Hill ROM is the second” means; who can credibly escalate to “top of the house.” (Doc: *Baxter IV & Legacy Hill Rom*)
- **Matching roadmap detail:** “ERP matching coming soon” timing/scope; referenced “10 Step Matching Process” details; validation approach. (Doc: *Identifying Specific Medical Devices…*)

## Recommended Next Actions

1) **Resolve the named overlap dependency (fast):** assign an owner and obtain Michelle’s clarification on **PHD vs Baxter Adv. Surg <> Premier overlap**, then socialize the answer to the working team. (Doc: *Baxter Adv. Surg Premier – Market Insights Follow up 71*)
2) **Lock “definitions first” working sessions:** schedule internal workshops to finalize **account definitions/groupings** and document the agreed standard (prerequisite for consistent targeting/reporting). (Doc: *Detailed Briefing Document…*)
3) **Publish a Baxter-facing “scope + cadence” one-pager:** confirm initial categories/use cases, deliverables (dashboards vs feeds), refresh cadence per dataset, and owners/timeline—since “next steps” are repeatedly referenced but not captured. (Docs: *Market Insights – Baxter – Jun 2025*, *Market Insights – Baxter – Jul 2025*, *Market Insights – Baxter – Proposal – Jun 2025*)
4) **Create a disruption-analytics methods appendix (internal/external-safe):** define baselines, timeframes, demand/unmet demand calculations, and SKU inclusion rules for IV fluids (and any future hemostatics disruption views). (Docs: *Market Insights – Baxter – Jun/Jul 2025*, *Market Insights – Baxter – Proposal – Jun 2025*)
5) **Address data accessibility constraints:** inventory which datasets are locked in HEOR SAS files, identify consuming teams, and propose an access pattern that improves usability (while acknowledging HEOR’s role). (Doc: *Baxter Background from John House*)
6) **Formalize executive sponsorship for Hill ROM IV + Advanced Surgery expansion work:** identify the sponsor who can take the proposal “to the top of the house,” and clarify the de-scoped vs in-scope work (incl. “Standard Hypo NPI support”). (Doc: *Baxter IV & Legacy Hill Rom*)
7) **GTM enablement cleanup for DSC messaging:** confirm BU approver, finalize budgets for “pending budget” tactics, and complete competitor sections currently marked “XXX” before broader external push. (Doc: *Digital Supply Chain Message Map*)
8) **Control external sharing rigorously:** ensure any externally shared linkage/matching materials exclude appendix/IP-designated slides and track what was distributed. (Doc: *Identifying Specific Medical Devices…*)
