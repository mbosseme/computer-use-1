## 1) Executive Summary (6–10 bullets)

- Premier presented **Market Insights** as a **data analytics platform to grow revenue and maximize margin**, aimed at supporting **Baxter’s growth strategies**.
- The platform is positioned to support multiple use cases: **contract performance**, **segmentation/targeting**, **supply chain resiliency**, **demand forecasting**, **market expansion**, and **channel partner management**.
- Data foundation highlighted: **PO, invoice, inventory, cross-reference, and master data** representing the **U.S. acute care market**, with **daily updates** and a single shared source (“**ALL STAKEHOLDERS ACCESS THE SAME DATA SOURCE**”).
- A major example focus was **U.S. acute care surgical hemostatic products**: a **$1.6B market growing at 11%**; Baxter cited at **$412M** and **25.9% share** (down from **27.3%** a year ago), with **JnJ** shown as the largest competitor.
- Within **absorbable powder (passive hemostats)**, Baxter was shown with **low share** (example: **$7.9M, 3.6% share**) and a stated goal to **increase PERCLOT market share**, supported by clinical/economic value proposition messaging.
- Portfolio expansion opportunity was discussed: a reported **$325M** segment (growing **>10% annually**) with a stated **gap for Sheets and Sponges**, and an illustrative potential of **10% share = $30M+ incremental U.S. revenue** (decision to pursue not documented).
- Premier described **linking clinical (chargemaster) to supply chain (purchasing) data** through charge description matching/cleansing to improve product matching and enable “clearer, more accurate analytics.”
- Premier confirmed an approach of **standardized clinical product & patient grouping** so only clinically comparable products/patient cases are analyzed together.
- Supply disruption examples were shown for **IV fluid bag-based products**, including market-share shifts during disruptions (e.g., **~3 pts to B. Braun**; **~6 pts mostly to ICU Medical and to B. Braun**) and a note that **pour bottle share has essentially recovered**.

## 2) Meeting Context

- **Stated purpose:** “Understand how Premier’s Market Insights data and analytics can support Baxter’s growth strategies.”
- **What was covered (per summaries):**
  - Overview of Market Insights capabilities and data sources (U.S. acute care coverage, daily refresh, multiple stakeholder access).
  - Demonstrations/examples spanning market sizing/share, targeting, and market expansion.
  - Deep examples centered on **surgical hemostatics** (share, growth, competitive positioning, and potential portfolio gaps).
  - Methodology for improving analytic accuracy by connecting clinical utilization to supply chain purchasing via **charge description matching/cleansing** and **standardized clinical grouping**.
  - Disruption/market dynamics examples in **IV fluids** (including North Cove plant shutdown context) and recovery dynamics in **pour bottles**.
- Several slides were noted as **“Blinded example” / “Prior work example”** (e.g., distributor substitutions, scorecards, disruption playbook, NPWT growth).

---

## 3) Key Decisions / Confirmations

- **Confirmed methodology:** “The Premier Clinical Team categorizes products and patient groups by clinical similarity” so that “only comparable products and patient cases are analyzed together.”
- **Confirmed observation (pour bottles):** “Market Share has essentially recovered.”
- **Other explicit decisions:** **Unknown** (no explicit decisions recorded in the provided summaries).

---

## 4) Open Questions / Follow-ups

- **Next steps:** The agenda referenced “Next Steps,” but **specific agreed next steps are unknown** (not provided in the summaries).
- **Surgical hemostatics disruption slide:** Details of “Supply Disruption Within Surgical Hemostatics” are **unknown** (title noted; content not captured).
- **Targeting outputs:** Which **specific accounts/segments** were prioritized from geographic/account targeting is **unknown**.
- **Portfolio expansion:** Whether Baxter will pursue expansion into **Sheets and Sponges** is **unknown** (presented as an opportunity/gap; no decision captured).
- **North Cove shutdown detail:** Which **specific products/SKUs** were included under “Products Affected by North Cove Plant Shutdown & Competitor Substitutes” is **unknown**.
- **Timeframe/definitions:** The **time period and geography** for the IV fluid market-share shifts (~3 pts / ~6 pts) are **unknown**.

---

## 5) Risks / Dependencies

- **Data linkage dependency:** The quality of insights depends on successful **matching/cleansing of clinical charge descriptions** to assign accurate catalog numbers/product attributes (risk if mapping is incomplete or inconsistent).
- **Interpretation risk (unknown timeframes):** Market-share shift figures for IV fluids are cited without timeframe/geography in the summaries, which may create **misinterpretation risk** until defined.
- **Supply disruption volatility:** Examples indicate disruptions can materially shift share (e.g., North Cove shutdown), suggesting **operational disruptions** remain a dependency for forecasting and commercial strategy.
- **Opportunity sizing assumptions:** The portfolio-gap revenue potential (e.g., “10% share = $30M+”) is an **illustrative claim**; realization depends on go-to-market and competitive response (details not documented).

Subject: Follow-up: Premier Market Insights discussion — proposed next steps

Hi [Name],

Thank you for the discussion on how Premier’s Market Insights data and analytics can support Baxter’s growth strategies. Based on what we reviewed (Market Insights use cases, the surgical hemostatics examples, and the clinical-to-supply-chain data linkage approach), could we align on the following items?

1) Confirm the specific “next steps” you’d like to prioritize (e.g., targeting/account list development, hemostatics opportunity deep-dive, disruption monitoring).  
2) Share the timeframe/geography behind the IV fluid market-share shift views (~3 pts / ~6 pts) and the SKU list for the North Cove shutdown impact slides.  
3) Confirm whether Baxter wants to further evaluate the “Sheets and Sponges” portfolio gap/opportunity.

If helpful, we can propose a short working session to finalize scope, required inputs, and deliverables.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
