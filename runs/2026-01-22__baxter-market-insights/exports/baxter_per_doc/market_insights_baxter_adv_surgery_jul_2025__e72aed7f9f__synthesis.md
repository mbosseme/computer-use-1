## 1) Executive Summary (6–10 bullets)

- The document’s purpose is to understand how Premier’s **Market Insights** data and analytics can support **Baxter’s growth strategies**.  
- Premier positions Market Insights as a **data analytics platform to grow revenue and maximize margin**, spanning contract performance, segmentation/targeting, supply chain resiliency, demand forecasting, market expansion, and channel partner management.  
- Market Insights is described as drawing from **PO, invoice, inventory, cross-reference, and master data**, representing the **U.S. acute care market** with **daily updates** (refresh cadence details vary by deliverable and are not fully specified).  
- Premier’s core enabling method is linking **clinical charge (chargemaster) data** with **supply chain purchasing data** by **cleansing and matching product descriptions**, then assigning catalog numbers/product attributes to charge data for clearer analytics.  
- Premier also standardizes **product and patient groupings** so utilization comparisons occur within **clinically comparable cohorts** (method confirmed; definitions/details not fully specified).  
- Example Baxter-focused analytics emphasize **U.S. Acute Care Surgical Hemostatic Products**, including a stated opportunity to **increase PERCLOT share** in **Absorbable Powders (Passive Hemostats)** and to address **portfolio gaps** (e.g., Absorbable Sheets/Sponges).  
- The deck includes market-sizing and competitive snapshot claims (e.g., surgical hemostatic market size/growth and Baxter share trends) and illustrative clinical utilization tables (explicitly labeled illustrative, not actual).  
- A disruption case study is shown for **IV fluids**, describing demand above pre-disruption levels, temporary market share shifts during disruption, and subsequent recovery (specific baselines/timeframes and certain referenced details are unknown).

## 2) Meeting Context

- **Stated objective:** “Understand how Premier’s Market Insights data and analytics can support Baxter’s growth strategies.”  
- **Confirmed agenda elements:**  
  - Introduction to the solution  
  - Real-life data demo covering **market size/share**, **clinical value proposition**, and **targeting**  
  - “Next Steps” section was included, but specific agreed next steps are **unknown** from the provided summaries.  
- **Illustrative category focus in examples:**  
  - Baxter **Surgical Hemostatics** (notably PERCLOT in absorbable powders; portfolio gap in absorbable sheets)  
  - Mentions of **Pre-Filled Syringe** and **NPWT** appear as examples/prior analyses.  
- **Data/model offerings referenced (customizable):**  
  - Provider Purchase Transaction Model  
  - Supply Signals Data Model (incl. “Future product supply risk predictions” and aggregate inventory levels with blinded competitive info)  
  - Performance Groups Compliance Model  
  - Hospital Targeting and Benchmarking Model

## 3) Key Decisions / Confirmations

- **Confirmed data linkage approach:** “Matching cleansed Facility Submitted Product Descriptions with Charge Descriptions links Charge and Supply data,” including assignment of catalog numbers and product attributes to charge data.  
- **Confirmed clinical comparability methodology:** Premier’s clinical team categorizes products and patient groups by **clinical similarity** so utilization comparisons are meaningful within comparable cohorts.  
- **Confirmed scope of the discussion (agenda-level):** intro + demo (market size/share, clinical value proposition, targeting) + “Next Steps” (details **unknown**).

## 4) Open Questions / Follow-ups

- **Next steps:** What specific next steps were agreed (if any), including owners and dates? (unknown)  
- **Scope:** Which Baxter categories beyond Surgical Hemostatics (and the mentioned Pre-Filled Syringe example) are in scope for implementation? (unknown)  
- **Deliverables & commercial terms:** What are the agreed deliverables, pricing, contract terms, and refresh cadence (daily vs weekly refresh references appear)? (unknown)  
- **Disruption slides not detailed:** What were the intended outputs/details for “Supply Disruption Within Surgical Hemostatics” and “Distributor Private Label Substitutions”? (unknown; only titles referenced)  
- **IV fluids disruption methodology details:**  
  - What timeframe defines “pre-disruption,” and what is the forecast horizon for “moderate growth”? (unknown)  
  - Which manufacturer’s “North Cove Plant Shutdown” is referenced and which specific products/categories are affected? (unknown)  
  - How are “demand,” “unmet demand,” and “market share” defined/calculated? (unknown)

## 5) Risks / Dependencies

- **Methodology transparency dependency:** Several disruption and forecasting claims are presented without fully specified baselines, horizons, or definitions (risk of misinterpretation until clarified).  
- **Refresh cadence ambiguity:** The platform is described as having “Daily Data updates,” while some deliverables/models reference weekly constructs/refreshes; implementation expectations depend on confirming the actual cadence per dataset/dashboard.  
- **Illustrative vs actual data risk:** At least one utilization table is explicitly “for illustrative purposes only,” so decisions should not rely on those figures without validated, client-specific extracts.  
- **Scope creep risk:** Multiple use cases are presented (contracting, targeting, supply signals, forecasting, channel partner management). Clear prioritization is needed to avoid an overly broad initial deployment.  
- **Data linkage dependency:** Analytics quality depends on successful cleansing/matching of facility-submitted product and charge descriptions; any variation in facility data quality could affect accuracy.

Subject: Follow-up: Premier Market Insights discussion – scope, deliverables, and next steps

Hi [Name],  
Thank you for the walkthrough of Premier Market Insights and the examples tied to Baxter growth opportunities (including surgical hemostatics/PERCLOT and broader market sizing/targeting use cases).

To align on next steps, could we confirm:
- The initial Baxter product categories and use cases in scope (beyond the surgical hemostatics examples, if applicable)  
- The specific deliverables (dashboards vs dataset delivery/BI integration), refresh cadence (daily vs weekly), and support/training plan  
- Commercial details (pricing/terms) and an implementation timeline with owners  
- Clarifications on the disruption/forecasting methodology (baseline period, forecast horizon, and definitions for demand/unmet demand/market share)

If helpful, we can set up a 30–45 minute working session to finalize scope and a draft project plan.

Best,  
[Your Name]
