## 5) Risks / Dependencies

- **Executive sponsorship risk:** If Caroline cannot credibly escalate, progress depends on securing a sponsor (potentially Rory or another leader) who can take the proposal to senior leadership.
- **Scope ambiguity risk:** Key terms (“Standard Hypo NPI support,” “Legacy Hill ROM is the second,” and the “deal”) are unclear, which may stall alignment and decision-making.
- **Budget/approval dependency:** Because IV and Advanced Surgery share a leader and budget, approval is likely **centralized**—creating dependency on a single decision path.

Subject: Aligning on scope and sponsorship for Hill ROM IV / Advanced Surgery market expansion

Hi [Name],

Based on our discussion, it sounds like there’s **less appetite for “Standard Hypo NPI support”** and stronger interest in **market expansion and targeting for Hill ROM IV and Advanced Surgery**. We also noted that **IV and Advanced Surgery roll up to the same leader and budget**, so we should align to that approval path.

To keep momentum, could we confirm:
1) What “Standard Hypo NPI support” specifically refers to (so we can formally de-scope or reframe it),  
2) What “Legacy Hill ROM is the second” means in terms of priority/sequence, and  
3) Who the right **exec sponsor** is to take the proposal “to the top of the house” (Rory or another leader).

If helpful, we can share a 1-page outline of the proposed market expansion/targeting scope for quick review.

Thanks,  
[Your Name]
