## 1) Executive Summary (6–10 bullets)

- Premier’s **Market Insights (MI)** is positioned as a **data-driven analytics platform** that integrates unique datasets to align **supply chain and clinical data** to support **manufacturer growth and product-line expansion**.
- MI’s core solution areas include **market/competitive intelligence**, **supply chain resiliency**, **demand forecasting & inventory optimization**, **utilization/consumption insights**, and **distributor/channel partner performance management**.
- Key differentiators emphasized are **granular visibility** (including **account/department detail** for certain Premier member groups), **predictive analytics/forecasting**, and **actionable/targeted insights**.
- MI is built on the **Premier Healthcare Database**, integrating **supply chain transactional/inventory/item master** data with **clinical/claims** and other datasets (examples cited: **genomics, SDOH**).
- Active manufacturer engagements/use cases referenced include **Boston Scientific, BD, Baxter, Solventum, Philips, and Stryker**.
- Strategic positioning includes Premier evolving into a **“Channel-Captain”** via scorecards, scaling an Accelerator program, and publishing the **“Premier Value Index.”**
- Competitive landscape noted: **Vizient, Truveta, SmartTRAK (BioMed GPS)** as more direct competitors; distributors’ offerings also compete; **IQVIA MDSA** is framed as a price benchmark and **not currently a major competitive threat for DSC for med device** (per document).
- Several internal/data-model items remain unresolved, including **account definition/grouping**, **lot/serial number integration**, **supplier rep territories**, **Rx/503B expansion**, pricing governance, and the definition of **“Best Modeled Member Definition.”**

## 2) Meeting Context

- The document describes Premier’s **Market Insights (MI)** offering, its data foundation, differentiators, competitive landscape, and examples of **manufacturer use cases/proposals** (e.g., Philips, Baxter, Boston Scientific).
- It also captures **open questions and internal alignment needs** related to data definitions, data integration (lot/serial), analysis dimensions (rep territories), and potential future scope (Rx/503B).
- **Unknown:** Specific meeting date, attendees, and whether this was a sales pitch, internal strategy session, or joint workshop are not provided in the chunk summary.

---

## 3) Key Decisions / Confirmations

- MI is confirmed/positioned as a platform that **integrates unique datasets** and aligns **supply chain + clinical data** to support manufacturer growth (explicitly stated positioning).
- **Solventum current license** is confirmed as: **“Data only for identifying opportunities from supply disruption and monitoring distributor performance (including private label substitution).”**
- A **Philips proposal** is confirmed to include a **3-year contract** model with **dedicated analysts from both Philips and Premier**, focused on mapping, model delivery, and initial view collaboration.

---

## 4) Open Questions / Follow-ups

- Align internally on **“internal definitions of what a customer account is and how they should be grouped.”**
- Determine feasibility/coverage and integration approach for **lot # / serial # data** (especially implantables and DME) and how to link it into the clinical data model (FDA RFPs/visibility referenced).
- Decide whether/how to incorporate **Supplier Rep territories** into analyses (not yet finalized).
- Evaluate whether/how MI should **expand into Rx**, including **“503B drugs.”**
- Address **pricing governance**: current pricing/tier structures are “often not reviewed or updated regularly” (no specific remediation steps captured).
- Clarify the definition and intended use of **“Best Modeled Member Definition”** (ideal customer definition based on product mix vs spend).

**Action items captured**
- Provide **dashboard samples** and a **data dictionary** to prospective clients (example cited: **Baxter BI**) to evaluate breadth and refresh cadence (**owner unknown** in summary).
- Continue internal work (Clarium Health) to map FDA/other sources to surface **SKU-level manufacturing locations** (**owner unknown** in summary).

---

## 5) Risks / Dependencies

- **Data definition dependency:** Progress depends on internal alignment around **account definitions/groupings**, which impacts reporting and segmentation.
- **Data integration risk:** Availability and linkage of **lot/serial data** to clinical models is unresolved; this could constrain device-level traceability/implantable and DME analytics.
- **Scope creep / roadmap risk:** Potential expansion into **Rx/503B** is not defined and could introduce new data, compliance, and analytic requirements (details unknown).
- **Commercial governance risk:** Pricing/tier structures “often not reviewed or updated regularly,” which could create inconsistency in contracting and renewals (next steps not specified).
- **Analytic model definition risk:** Lack of clarity on **“Best Modeled Member Definition”** may create inconsistencies in targeting and value sizing.

## 6) Suggested Next-Step Email (short draft)

Subject: Next Steps on Premier Market Insights (MI) – data definitions, samples, and open items

Hi [Name],  
Thanks for the discussion on Premier’s Market Insights (MI). To keep momentum, we propose the following next steps:

- Share **dashboard samples** and a **data dictionary** so your team (e.g., BI stakeholders) can assess **breadth and refresh cadence**.  
- Align on **customer account definitions/groupings** (how accounts should be defined and rolled up).  
- Confirm your priorities on the remaining open items: **lot/serial number coverage and linkage to clinical data**, whether to include **rep territories**, and any interest in **Rx/503B** scope.

Please let us know who should be included for the account-definition working session and the best timing this week/next.

Best,
