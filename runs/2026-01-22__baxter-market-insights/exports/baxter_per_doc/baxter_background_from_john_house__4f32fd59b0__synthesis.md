## 1) Executive Summary (6–10 bullets)

- The document centers on a data accessibility concern: the HEOR group is described as “monopoliz[ing] the data.”
- HEOR is storing data in “SAS files,” which is explicitly called out as making the data “less accessible for other teams.”
- Catherine is confirmed to be part of HEOR and to “use SAS.”
- John has a pre-existing relationship with Catherine (“John knows Catherine well”).
- Tyler Wunder is mentioned, but the context is unclear; it is unknown what role/team he is in and what he is “not.”
- No specific datasets are named in the provided summary (unknown which data is being discussed).
- No decision is recorded about changing the current data storage/access approach (unknown whether a change is intended).
- No action items are captured in the provided summary.

## 2) Meeting Context

- Topic appears to be cross-team data access and how data is stored/managed.
- Current state: HEOR retains control of the data and stores it in SAS files, reducing accessibility to other teams.
- Relevant stakeholders mentioned: Catherine (HEOR, SAS user), John (knows Catherine), and Tyler Wunder (mentioned; details unknown).

## 3) Key Decisions / Confirmations

- Confirmed: Catherine is in HEOR and “uses SAS.”
- Confirmed: HEOR stores the data in SAS files, which makes it “less accessible for other teams.”
- No other decisions/confirmations are present in the provided chunk summary.

## 4) Open Questions / Follow-ups

- Tyler Wunder: What team/role is he in, and what specifically is he “not” (e.g., not in HEOR, not using SAS)? **Unknown**.
- What specific datasets are being referenced? **Unknown**.
- Is there an intended change to improve data accessibility, and if so, what approach is being considered? **Unknown**.

## 5) Risks / Dependencies

- **Risk (collaboration/velocity):** If data remains primarily controlled by HEOR and stored in SAS files, other teams may continue to experience limited access and slower progress.
- **Dependency (people/process):** Any improvement likely depends on HEOR participation/approval and coordination with Catherine (as a named HEOR SAS user). The specific governance model is **unknown**.
- **Dependency (technical):** Current reliance on SAS file storage may constrain broader usability for teams not set up to consume SAS files (exact constraints are **unknown**).

Subject: Follow-up on HEOR data access and SAS file storage

Hi all,  
I’m following up on the discussion that HEOR is currently storing the data in SAS files, which is making it less accessible for other teams. We also confirmed Catherine is in HEOR and uses SAS.

Could we clarify:
- Which specific datasets are in scope?
- Whether there is an intended change to improve accessibility (and what options we should evaluate)?
- Tyler Wunder’s role/team and how he relates to this workflow?

Thanks,  
[Your Name]
