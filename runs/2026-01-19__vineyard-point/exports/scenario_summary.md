Notes:

- 'Premium' is: (out-of-pocket after rent offset) minus 'rent-instead' cost for the owner-use weeks.

- 'Econ premium' is: average annual cost (includes a simplified sale estimate) minus 'rent-instead'.

- This model is intentionally simple; treat it as directional until HOA rules + rent comps are verified.
