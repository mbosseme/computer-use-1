# HANDOFF — 2026-01-19__vineyard-point

Run status: ACTIVE

## Current target
- Development: Vineyard Point / Dockside condos (Lake Norman-adjacent)
- Address anchor: 18861 Vineyard Point Ln, Cornelius, NC 28031
- Likely unit: ~2 bed / 2 bath, ~782 sq ft (small condo)

## Decision framing (summary)
- Intent: owned “vacation club / timeshare-like” experience (not profit-max)
- Owner use: ~2–4 weeks/year, in multiple 2-week blocks (calendar fragmentation risk)
- Rentals: **30+ day minimum** (no nightly/weekly), professionally managed, furnished mid-term
- Goal: cost offset + low effort; acceptable premium vs renting: <= ~$5k/yr
- Cash constraint: ~$100k total for down payment + closing + reserves + furnishing/renovation

## Work completed
- 2026-01-19: Switched target property from Alexander Chase to Vineyard Point; archived old run docs.

## Next steps
- Build Vineyard Point model (5–7 year horizon; mortgage + furnished mid-term + 30-day-min calendar constraints).
- Research comps and property managers; record sources.
- Produce decision memo + checklists in `properties/vineyard_point/` and calculation exports in `runs/2026-01-19__vineyard-point/exports/`.
