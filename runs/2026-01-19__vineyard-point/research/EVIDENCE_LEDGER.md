# Evidence Ledger — Vineyard Point (18861 Vineyard Point Ln)

## Question
What’s the best evidence-backed estimate of:
1) Monthly rent achievable for a furnished **30+ day** lease for a ~2/2 condo near Cornelius / Lake Norman.
2) Whether a condo HOA is likely to allow / restrict 30+ day leases, and what to verify.
3) Whether local managers exist who can handle furnished mid-term (30+ day) rentals and typical fee ranges.

## Tier selected + why
Tier 2 (Tavily search → extract), because stakes are medium/high (real money, HOA compliance), and we need defensible evidence with bounded uncertainty.

## Synthesis (claims → supporting passages)
- Claim: A plausible all-in furnished 30+ day monthly rent band near Cornelius/Lake Norman for a condo can be around ~$2,800/month (including utilities), with some furnished units advertised around ~$3,100/month.
	- Support: CHBO property 24337 lists "Minimum Stay Required: 1 Month" and "Rental Rate $2800 Per Month" and states "Includes all utilities/wifi".
	- Support: Zumper shows a "Furnished condo" at "18713 Vineyard Point Ln" for "$3,100".

- Claim: The exact target unit (18861) has been marketed as a conventional 12-month unfurnished rental, implying an unfurnished long-term baseline in the ~$1.8k–$2.0k/month range (platforms vary).
	- Support: Realtor.com rental listing shows "Lease Term: 12 Months" and "Furnished Description: Unfurnished".

- Claim: HOA dues vary meaningfully across Vineyard Point complexes; underwriting should include a range rather than a single point estimate until the specific Dockside HOA budget is confirmed.
	- Support: ExploreCorneliusHomes.com states "HOA Dues: $194.00 – $388.00 depending on compliex".

- Claim: Multiple listings within Dockside/Vineyard Point explicitly market that "30 day rentals" are allowed (strong but still secondary evidence until governing docs are obtained).
	- Support: Zillow listing text for 18807 Vineyard Point Ln says "30 days rentals allowed".
	- Support: Palmetto Park Realty listing for 18867 Vineyard Point Ln says "allows a minimum of 30 day rentals".
	- Support: housesincharlotte.com MLS mirror for 18867 Vineyard Point Ln repeats "allows a minimum of 30 day rentals".

- Claim: The HOA contact shown on one Dockside/Vineyard Point listing likely corresponds to the association management company “William Douglas”, and provides a concrete lead for obtaining governing docs.
	- Support: Zillow listing for 18807 shows "Association name: William Douglas" and "Association phone: 704-230-3131".
	- Support: Northview Harbour HOA PDF references "William Douglas Management Company" and "Phone 704-230-3131".

- Claim: Fully-managed furnished models (STR-style) in the Lake Norman area can advertise management fees around 20% of gross revenue; this is a plausible upper-bound fee signal for “hands-off” furnished management.
	- Support: Wishlist pricing page states "Management Fee 20% for Short-Term Rental Management".
	- Support: CoHost USA Thumbtack listing states "We charge 20% for full-service vacation rental property management.".

- Claim: Long-term (unfurnished) property management in the Lake Norman region can be marketed around ~10%/month, which provides a low-end anchor (mid-term furnished will likely cost more than this).
	- Support: Alarca Cornelius page advertises "Special 7% /mo" and indicates "(Normally 10%/mo)".

- Claim: Leasing fees can be materially larger than the fixed $250–$1,000/lease assumptions used in our first-pass model runs (some long-term managers advertise leasing fees as a fraction of one month’s rent).
	- Support: Alarca Cornelius page advertises "Leasing Fee 50% of one month’s rent" and "Renewal Fee $249".

- Claim: A reasonable utilities + internet placeholder for a ~900 sq ft unit in the Charlotte region is on the order of ~$160/mo utilities + ~$60/mo internet (directional proxy for Cornelius).
	- Support: Jeff Cook Real Estate Charlotte cost-of-living guide states "A 900 square foot apartment incurs an average of $159 per month in utilities" and "Standard 60 Mbps Internet plans average $60 each month".

- Claim: Turnover cleaning cost for a 2 bed / 2 bath apartment is often quoted in the ~$125–$200 range (with higher costs for deep clean / move-out), which makes a ~$200-ish turnover-clean assumption a conservative but plausible placeholder.
	- Support: HomeAdvisor table lists "2 bed, 2 bath ... $125–$200" for regular cleaning.
	- Support: CHBO property 24337 lists a one-time "Cleaning Fee" of $350 (likely closer to a move-out / deeper clean than a standard recurring clean).

## Uncertainties / assumptions
- Need primary HOA governing documents (Declaration/Bylaws/Rules) for Vineyard Point / Dockside condos.
- Rent comps from listing platforms vary by unit quality, included utilities, and seasonality.
- Listing text is not legally binding; treat the “30 day rentals” claims as a lead to verify in HOA documents.

## Confidence
- Medium (until HOA docs and on-the-ground rent comps are verified)

## Next actions / checklist
- Obtain HOA rental rules (min term, caps, approval process, enforcement).
- Pull 5–10 direct 2/2 furnished monthly comps within ~10 miles.
- Confirm manager willingness and fee structure for 30+ day furnished (not nightly STR).
