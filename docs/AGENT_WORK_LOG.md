# AGENT_WORK_LOG (Moved)

This log was split:
- Core repo improvement log (append-only): [docs/CORE_REPO_WORK_LOG.md](CORE_REPO_WORK_LOG.md)
- Per-session narratives: [notes/agent-runs/](../notes/agent-runs/)
- Per-run handoff journal (run-local): `runs/<RUN_ID>/HANDOFF.md`

(Kept as a short pointer for back-compat.)
