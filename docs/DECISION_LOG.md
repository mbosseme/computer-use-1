# Decision Log

This is a lightweight, append-only log of key decisions that change the direction of a run or analysis.

## 2026-01-19 — Switched target property to Vineyard Point
- Decision: Switched evaluation target from **Alexander Chase (Cornelius, NC)** to **Vineyard Point / Dockside condos** (address anchor: 18861 Vineyard Point Ln, Cornelius, NC 28031).
- Rationale: New opportunity better fits an “owned vacation base” goal, with rental cost-offset via **furnished 30+ day stays** and **full-service property management**, while preserving ability for multiple 2-week owner blocks.
- Implication: Previous Alexander Chase work is archived; current analysis focuses on 5–7 year horizon, 30+ day leasing constraints, and calendar fragmentation risk.
