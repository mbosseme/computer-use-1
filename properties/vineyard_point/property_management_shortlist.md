# Property Management Feasibility — furnished 30+ day stays

Goal: shortlist “full-service-ish” managers near Cornelius / Lake Norman / Huntersville / Mooresville that can handle furnished mid-term rentals (30+ days).

Status: Draft; will be updated with web research sources.

## What we need (non-negotiables)
- 30+ day leasing support (not Airbnb-only)
- Marketing + screening + lease execution
- Turnover coordination + cleaning
- Restocking basics + minor replacement handling (dishware, linens, etc.)
- Vendor dispatch + issue resolution with light-touch owner approvals
- Regular inspection cadence + photo reports

## Service expectations checklist (draft)
- Do they coordinate linen service and consumables?
- Do they proactively inspect and document condition?
- Do they handle small replacements under a spending threshold?
- Do they provide tenant communication coverage 24/7?
- Do they handle HOA compliance (leases, approvals, parking)?
