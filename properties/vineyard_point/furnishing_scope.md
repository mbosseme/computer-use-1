# Renovation / Furnishing Scope Assumptions (small 2/2 condo ~782 sq ft)

Principles:
- Durability-first (furnished mid-term wear-and-tear)
- Avoid over-customization
- Improve rentability *and* resale where possible

## $10k — minimum viable
- Safety/comfort basics; fix obvious wear
- Core furnishings with durable, cleanable surfaces
- Minimal cosmetic upgrades

## $25k — solid mid-tier furnished rental
- Replace/upgrade the highest-visible and highest-wear items
- Durable, cohesive design (not luxury)
- Better sleep comfort + blackout shades + high-quality linens
- Small kitchen + bath refresh where ROI is highest

## $30k — slightly higher finish, still durable
- Incremental upgrades only where it improves reviews/rent and resale
- Emphasize hard-wearing materials, not fragile trendy finishes

## Durability-first recommendations (draft)
- Flooring: LVP or durable existing flooring; avoid high-maintenance materials
- Paint: scrubbable satin/eggshell; washable touch-up kit
- Furniture: performance fabrics; removable/washable covers where possible
- Mattress: hotel-grade; protectors + spare linens
- Kitchen: uniform dishware set; replaceable, standardized items

(Will be expanded with a room-by-room list and estimated line-item costs.)
