# HOA Constraints — Verification Checklist (Vineyard Point / Dockside)

Status: **PENDING VERIFICATION** until HOA docs are obtained.

## Known leads (from public listings; still requires primary-doc verification)
- Multiple Dockside/Vineyard Point listings explicitly advertise “30 day rentals allowed” / “minimum of 30 day rentals”. Treat as a lead, not proof.
- One Dockside/Vineyard Point listing shows HOA contact:
	- Association name: William Douglas

Action: call/email the HOA manager and request the current governing documents + any rental policy resolutions.
