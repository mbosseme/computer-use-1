# Decision Memo: Vineyard Point (V7.2)
**Date:** 2026-01-19
**Status:** Review for Offer

## 1. Executive Summary
**Context:**  
Evaluates Vineyard Point purchase (2BR Lakefront, $355k) under **V7.2 assumptions**: Strict Tax rules, verified HOA, and User-Defined Rental Income/Savings assumptions.

**Critical Inputs (V7.2):**
1.  **HOA:** **$297/month** (Verified).
2.  **Tax Logic:** **Strict Passive Loss Rules** (No W-2 offset).
3.  **Rent Alternative:** **$2,500/week** (User Requirement: "We assume $10k/month to rent").
4.  **Rental Income:** **$3,800/month** (User Requirement: Gross MTR income target).

**The Verdict:**
*   **2 Weeks Use:** **Expensive.** (Premium to Own: ~$4,400/yr). Buying costs more than renting.
*   **4 Weeks Use:** **Breakeven / Buy.** (Premium to Own: ~$200/yr). *This is the Tipping Point.*
*   **6 Weeks Use:** **Strong Buy.** (Savings: ~$4,000/yr).
*   **8 Weeks Use:** **Strong Buy.** (Savings: ~$8,100/yr).

**Recommendation:**  
The math now supports a **Buy** decision if you use the property for just **4 weeks (1 month) per year**. The combination of high rental income ($3,800/mo) and avoiding high rental costs ($10k/mo) creates a compelling arbitrage.

## 2. The Decision Grid (Buy vs. Rent)

**Base Case:** 7-Year Hold, 3% Appreciation, 70% Occupancy ($3,800/mo MTR).

| User Weeks | Cost to Rent ($2.5k/wk) | Net Cost to Own (V7.2) | Result (Cash Difference) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2 Weeks** | $5,000 | $9,409 | **Buy costs $4,409 more** |
| **4 Weeks** | $10,000 | $10,225 | **Buy costs $225 more (Breakeven)** |
| **6 Weeks** | $15,000 | $11,042 | **Buy SAVES $3,958** |
| **8 Weeks** | $20,000 | $11,858 | **Buy SAVES $8,142** |

*Note: "Net Cost to Own" accounts for Cash Flow + Principal Paydown + Equity at Sale.*

## 3. Discrepancy Reconciliation (Final)
We have aligned the model to your specific market position:
*   **As a Renter (You):** You face **STR Pricing** ($2,500/week = $10k/month) because you rent in short bursts.
*   **As an Owner (You):** You capture **High-End MTR Pricing** ($3,800/month).
*   **Result:** This gap creates the value. By owning, you swap a $10k/month liability for a $3.8k/month asset + operating costs.

## 4. Financial Mechanics (V7.2)

### A. Cash Flow (Year 1 - 4 Weeks Use)

*   **Mgmt/Leasing:** -$7,013 (20% fee + turnover costs)
*   **Mortgage Payment:** -$23,764 (P&I)
*   **Net Cash Flow:** **-$12,762 / year** (Check writing: ~$1,060/month).

### B. Wealth Accumulation
*   **Principal Paydown:** ~$4,800/yr
*   **Appreciation (3%):** ~$11,000/yr
*   **Tax Benefit:** $0/yr (Suspended) -> **$15k/yr** released at Sale.

## 5. Sensitivity Analysis (4 Weeks Use)

**HOA Impact:**
Even with value fluctuation, the 4-week use case remains near breakeven.
*   **$297 HOA:** Cost $10,225 (Buy Premium: $225)
*   **$550 HOA:** Cost $13,261 (Buy Premium: $3,261) -> *Push usage to 5 weeks to justify.*

**Appreciation Impact:**
*   At **5% Appreciation**, the "Buy" case saves **$13,500/year** vs Renting even at 4 weeks use.
