**Date:** January 19, 2026

## 1. The Executive Summary

**The "Free Lunch" is gone.** 
Our deep-dive into the tax code confirms that as a high-income earner using the home >14 days/year, this property is classified as a "Residence" under IRS Section 280A. **You cannot deduct losses against your W-2 income.** The mortgage interest deduction is also likely capped out on your primary home.

**The Result:** You are underwriting this deal purely on its own cash flow and appreciation merits, with zero tax subsidy.

**The Verdict:**
*   **As an Investment:** **FAIL.** It burns cash (-$14k to -$22k/year) and offers lower ROI than an index fund.
*   **As a Second Home:** **VIABLE, BUT NOT CHEAP.** In the best-case scenario, it builds slightly more wealth than renting (~$2k/yr advantage), but requires a heavy monthly cash contribution (~$1,200/mo).

## 2. The Economics (Tax-Neutral)

We modeled 29,160 scenarios. Here is the realistic range for a 7-year hold:

| Scenario | Conditions | Annual Cash Burn (Out of Pocket) | Net Wealth Impact vs. Renting |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"Best Case"** | Rent $3,100 / 90% Fill / 7% Mgmt | **-$14,500 / yr** (~$1,200/mo) | **+$2,000 / yr** (Wealthier than renting) |
| **"Moderate Case"** | Rent $2,800 / 75% Fill / 10% Mgmt | **-$21,600 / yr** (~$1,800/mo) | **-$5,100 / yr** (Poorer than renting) |
| **"Stress Case"** | Rent $2,400 / 60% Fill / 15% Mgmt | **-$26,000 / yr** (~$2,200/mo) | **-$9,500 / yr** (Poorer than renting) |

*   **Net Wealth Impact** = (Appreciation + Principal Paydown) - (Global Cash Burn including Sell Costs) - (Cost of Renting Instead)
*   **Positive** means Owning beats Renting. **Negative** means Renting beats Owning.

**Key Insight:** To beat renting, you **MUST** hit the "Best Case" operating targets. If you slip to "Moderate" (lower rent, higher fees), you are effectively paying a **$5,100/year "Lifestyle Premium"** for the privilege of owning vs. renting.

## 3. The "Price of Admission"
To own this home, you must be comfortable with:
1.  **Upfront Cash:** ~$82,000 (20% Down + Closing + Furnishing + Reserves).
2.  **Monthly Burn:** Writing a check for **$1,200–$1,800 every month** to cover the deficit between rent and expenses.
3.  **Illiquidity:** Your money is trapped for 5-7 years.

## 4. Why Do It? (The Intangibles)
If the numbers are tight, the decision rests on the non-monetary value:
*   **Guaranteed Availability:** No fighting for bookings during peak summer/holidays.
*   **Storage:** Leaving your boat/gear there (priceless vs. hauling it).
*   **Personalization:** Setting it up exactly how you want.
*   **Pride of Ownership:** The emotional value of "your place."

If these intangibles are worth **>$5,000/year** to you, the deal makes sense even in the Moderate case.

## 5. Critical Operating Gates (Must Verify)
Before removing contingencies, you must verify the assumptions that keep us in the "Best Case" zone:

1.  **Leasing Fee Structure:**
    *   **Requirement:** Must be **Flat Fee ($250-$500/lease)**.
    *   **Risk:** If a manager charges 50% of 1st month's rent ($1,500), the premium increases by ~$4,000/year, instantly pushing you into the "Loss" zone.
    *   **Action:** Get the Alarca Quote in writing.

2.  **HOA Rental Rules:**
    *   **Requirement:** Confirm 30-day rentals are permitted and practicable (keys, gate access, parking).
    *   **Action:** Read the Covenants & Restrictions (CC&Rs) personally.

3.  **Rent Comparables:**
    *   **Requirement:** Confidence in **$2,800–$3,100** for furnished monthly rentals.
    *   **Action:** Check furnished finder / Airbnb monthly discounts for specific comps in Cornelius.

## 6. Final Recommendation

**Proceed only if:**
1.  You accept the **$1,200–$1,800 monthly negative cash flow** as a consumption cost, not an investment loss.
2.  You verify the **Alarca 7% / $250 fee** structure is real.
3.  You plan to hold for **7+ years** (to allow appreciation to overcome transaction costs).

If you are looking for a "smart investment" that pays for itself with tax breaks: **This is not it.** 
If you are looking for a funded lifestyle asset that beats renting *if managed perfectly*: **This is a workable buy.**
